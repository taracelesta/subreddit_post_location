1. A Mp3 player and some earbuds
With sd technology the way it is you can easily fit close to 24 hours of songs into less than an ounce of pack weight. Theres nothing like the sweet sound of sea shanties to make the long march seem a little less long

2. Drink Mix Flavor Bombs, (Credit to Scoutmaster Sam for this one Take your favorite drink mix, measure out an appropriate amount for your water container, put it in a sandwich bag, tie it closed, cut off excess  bag.  To use, pinch/twist off the corner and add to your drink. It makes you more likely to drink and it allows you to get calories from your beverage. 

3. Cards
You can play a surprising amount of games of solitaire before you get bored. If you‚Äôre lost with a buddy then your entertainment options are limitless.

4. Caffeine Pills
Lightweight and some of the stronger varieties can probably wake the dead. Will keep you trudging. 

5. The classic kindle Ereader
Weighing at a whopping 6.7 ounces a properly stocked ereader can provide limitless entertainment and can hold charge for upwards of a month of continuous use.

Guitar strings!,6,j9wxzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/j9wxzd/guitar_strings/,1,1602557462.0,"Was reorganizing one of my bug-out bags, and ran across something I don't think has been mentioned on here before: the easiest and most reliable snare I've ever used, a steel, high-E guitar string with a ball end. I keep 4 in my BOB. 

I have used these in the wild, and they are supremely easy. First, find a rabbit or animal run that looks well used, and locate a small tree or solid bush next to it. Thread the bare end of the guitar string through the ball end, like threading a needle, forming the snare loop. Firmly attach the bare end of the string to the anchor point, so that the snare loop is about 10"" wide and hanging in the run. Check your snares at least once daily, up to three times if you can. The wire will securely trap the animal, and often strangle it if it gets around their neck.

I‚Äôm thinking about doing some survival events, either self directed or as part of a directed program, that limit you to one fixed blade as your only cutting tool (really your only tool of any kind).

This sounds ridiculous I know but help me out here haha 

So my apartment complex has been overrun with raccoons for a long time now. It‚Äôs a pretty nice complex and I pay a lot for rent. They used to put a ladder in the dumpster everyday for raccoons to crawl out of because they would accidentally pick up like 10 raccoons in the garbage truck. It‚Äôs right next to a park and creek so it‚Äôs a good spot for them to live and snag some food. They aren‚Äôt really scared of people which is fine because they usually keep to themselves. I have never had a problem with them. They grab their trash and go. 

There is a little hole in the chain link fence that leads to the park right down the side walk of my apartment. Last night I was taking my two dogs out (big dogs-border collie/Aussie) and some ran ahead of us from the parking lot and through the hole. 
One of my dogs barked so I paused and once the raccoons were through the hole I kept walking. One of the raccoons ran back through the hole after he was already a bit away and literally charged us. One of my dogs was snapping and barking so aggressively but the raccoon was not even a little bit phased. I started backing up to give it space and get my dogs away but it would not stop coming. It was hissing and making a really loud noise. My dogs were freaking out and I started retreating as fast as I could while getting my dogs under control and keeping an eye on it. 

My dogs are up to date on rabies but I didn‚Äôt want to take chances. I started running and I was screaming a bit. It wasn‚Äôt the raccoon itself but they carry very deadly diseases. It chased me a really long ways. People came out to their balcony because of the commotion and were yelling. The raccoon was sticking to the fence which is covered in a thick bushy vine and would randomly jump out and try to bite. It chased me all the way to the base of my stairs until I was up the first flight (it was a really long distance). 

When I got to the top where the staircase is open the people on the balconies were talking to me and my friend who had watched the whole thing go down from my balcony. She said that everyone thought it was a mountain lion because it was hissing so loud and was banging through the vine against the fence so it seemed bigger than it was. 
I felt so silly but everyone said it was really terrifying to watch. 

I thought it had to be diseased because it chased me such a far distance and so aggressively. It was not trapped in a corner and it wasn‚Äôt defensive it was literally on the offense. 

I called my apartment complex the next morning because I didn‚Äôt want it to happen to anyone else and they seemed to take me seriously and told me they would look into the fence. They asked me to call animal control and have AC call them. 
So I did but AC said they can‚Äôt do anything until it bites someone. They said they weren‚Äôt going to go around banging bushes to find it and testing them for rabies was a really long process. He said raccoons in the area just aren‚Äôt scared of people and I probably got near it‚Äôs territory (it‚Äôs the sidewalk of my apartment so the raccoons shouldn‚Äôt have territory there??) 

I called the apartment complex back and told them what AC said and I asked them if they wanted me to send them a picture of the hole because it‚Äôs hard to find or if I could show it to them in person. 
She got really condescending and started calling me ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù (I am a 25yr old woman so that was offensive to be talked to as a child and not get the respect of a resident) she said she would go find the hole later but they would have to find a way to secure a chain link fence and the raccoons could climb over it anyways. I said that I understood that but maybe getting rid of the easy access would discourage them from being directly in that area. 

I now hate the raccoons in the area which is fair and I don‚Äôt want someone to get bit before they take action (what if a child got bit?). Either way no one is going to do anything at this point. 

I still have to take my dogs out at night. I would never suggest a gun and I‚Äôm scared if I used pepper spray it would just blow in me or my dog‚Äôs faces and then we wouldn‚Äôt be able  to see to get away from the raccoon. 

They are small and I know my dogs could easily fight it and I could too probably but I would get scratched and bit if I tried to kick it or something. I‚Äôm not trying to get me or my dogs bit because they are such high carriers of disease. 

it‚Äôs so silly to be scared of such a small cute animal but the potential for deadly diseases is serious when they are attacking. 
They are not scare of noises or stomping or movement. 

Does anyone have any advice on a weapon to use in defense against a raccoon when I take my dogs out at night? üòÇ",survival

Question about Trapping and game types,3,j1z5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/j1z5er/question_about_trapping_and_game_types/,6,1601414750.0,"This question is about Wilderness Survival, BUT for some rulesets I am making for D&D. It doesn't seem to be explicitly against the rules but...\*shug\*

I am looking to get a better understanding of non-region specific game types that can realistically be caught with traps. I tried Googling it and I got some good info, but mostly I was digging through PETA and Animal Rights pages that overwhelmed the search. I figured this subreddit would be a good place to get some insight from real people who know what they are talking about.

My players in D&D have found that they love trapping game (and hunting/fishing) while traveling. They set their traps at night and check them in the morning, the result of the trap is based on their ""Survival"" skill. Currently we are one session in, and I've been winging it with generalizations depending on their rolls ""You caught nothing"", ""You caught a squirrel/hare"", ""You caught a boar/deer"", ""You caught a bear"" (In a very rare instance).

I'd like to make this somewhat more realistic. I realize that D&D can never be realistic, especially in that there is just a generic ""Hunting Trap"" rather than something appropriately sized and baited for the specific game. I'm looking to get a handle on animals that can realistically be caught in a trap.

These are land traps, essentially a Jaw Trap.

So far I have:

Small Game

* squirrel
* rabbit/hare
* rat
* pheasant
* quail
* grouse
* partridge
* pheasant
* duck
* groundhog
* skunk
* bobcat
* weasel
* badger
* porcupine

Medium Game

* fox
* lynx
* beaver
* otter
* wombat
* dingo
* turkey
* goose
* monitor

Large Game

* boar
* goat
* sheep
* deer
* Ostrich/Moa
* Emu
* bison

Special Game (turns into a fight)

* kangaroo
* bear
* moose (??)
* wolf
* panther/cougar/mt. lion
* (Some kind of predatory bird)

I'd like to fill out these lists a bit more with real possibilities, such as Is a moose even logical? Region doesn't matter I can do that on my end.

I found this a couple of months ago, and it opened my eyes. I'm an owner of a Fallkniven A1 and S1 knives. Bought mostly with the idea that a strong reliable knife is the way to gon, but if you understand your tools and know a handful of skills even the crappiest of knives can get you a long way. Since then I've been using a Swiss Army Knife (Alox Farmer X) more and more as a way of practice my skills and I must say, it changed my philosophy thoroughly when it comes to wood processing tools.

Now I'm not saying you should all replace your fixed blade knife in your kit with a SAK. But if you consider buying/selecting a knife for your kit, maybe consider a smaller option. When it comes to a survival kit, weight is always a big concern. Besides that, smaller blades are better suited for finer task and these finer tasks can also be very important in a survival situation. 

Most of all, practice with different tools for the job. Know what to do when you don't have the ideal tool at hand, learn how to split wood without batoning on your blade or without an axe, and learn how to properly use folding knives where you're at. 

It's a good ideology in general when it comes to honing outdoor skills, not just knives.

\- Handle size. Apparently the handle is too small? I don't have particularly large hands for a man, I'd say about average (glove size about 10) but still...

\- Sheath. From what I can see the sheath does not provide a locking mechanism for the knive to not fall out unless it is some sort of clipping mechanism inside the sheath? Does anyone have any experience here?

\- Steel. Most of their models are using the 1095 which apparently makes them extremely durable but you will have to care for it more (grease the blade to prevent corrosion). They do have a 440C version of the ESEE but they state in their warranty explanation that this one will not be as durable.

By that, I mean training myself to function more in dark or low light situations. I think this could have countless applications in a survival situation, and Hope that it will benefit me.

But I have my camping grab bag that still needs to be rounded out before my AT trip next year.  I found my vaseline cotton ball container, gonna top that up at some point.  I have SO MUCH FATWOOD in case I run out of the good shit. However, I don't have any knives suitable for batoning.  I have a BUCK which I would trust to hold together but it is a short drop point, and, well, it doesn't provide any surfaces to baton. I could hammer the wood I'm trying to split onto the ground or a rock, but I'm not great with angles and I fear flinging the wood off somewhere.  It's already almost happened, and I don't wanna succeed cuz that's kind of opposite the goal of safety. Great for feathersticks, wood points, making little whittled things, but not great for splitting.

I also have a long-ish bladed elk ridge, but, this knife likes to give me handle trouble, and I mainly do not overly trust this knife alone without a backup.  It also gets dull extremely fast, and I somewhat regret this purchase. 

Anybody have favorites for a moderately tight budget?  Maybe, hmm, like below $40?

Review of Multiple Fire Sources,14,ix2fpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ix2fpz/review_of_multiple_fire_sources/,6,1600730409.0,"Hello reddit, the objective of buying multiple fire starting tools is to prevent the risk of being unable to start a fire due to damage or depleted resources.

I bought a variety of fire starting products on 9/20/2020, windy, with a temperature range of 43 F to 63 F, depending on the time of day. All product links meet Grade A or Grade B of the FakeSpot Rating System, and hold 4.5 to 5 stars.

Classic Bic Lighter ($10.49) Bic lighters will almost always work, but if it is cold, you will have to warm it up with your hands. Classic Bic Lighters hold an hour worth of fuel. If you do the math, 60 Minutes X 60 Seconds, you get 3600 seconds. If you get a fire in a maximum of 10 seconds for all fire attempts, that is 360 fires per Classic Bic Lighter, or 7.89 Years (8 lighters X 360 days = 2880 days, 2880 days / 365 days = 7.89 years)

Pros:

Reliable fire source due to the flame

Fast fire starting due to the flame

The flint can be used after empty fuel

Cons:

Short Usage Period for each bic lighter

Possible leakage of fluid over time

Possible cracking during direct impact

Possible Explosions during high heat

Not Waterproof

Not Water Resistant

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Ferro Rod 1.5 x 6 inches ($14.99) This is the only product I have not bought, but due to its popularity, I did my research on the product to find the best brand and product.

To be speak safely, one ferro rod will provide 10,000 sparks. If it takes a maximum of 10 strikes to start a fire, you will have 1,000 fires, or 2,000 fires if 5 strikes is attempted. This is 1,000 to 2,000 fires per rod. 1,000 fires / 365 = 2.75 Years per rod or 2,000 fires / 365 = 5.5 Years per rod. Since there is two rods in the link listed below, that is 5.5 years if each rod provides 2.75 years (1,000 fires per rod), or 11 years if each rod provides 5.5 years (2,000 fires per rod).

Pros:

Reliable due to amount and temperature of sparks

Impact Resistant due to the metal strength

Waterproof since it is only a metal

Water resistant since it is only a metal

Cons:

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Pocket Size Fresnal Lens ($4.75) Surprisingly, the pocket size fresnal lens started a fire with a piece of charcloth in under 10 seconds, even during the cold and windy day. Fresnal Lens should last forever if scratches are prevented, since plastic decays after a several thousand years. Within the link listed below, each fresnal lens comes in individual sleeves, which are collectively within a larger thick clear pouch. Therefore, the only way to deeply scratch these lens is by taking the fresnal lens out of the individual sleeves.

Pros:

Can be used to alert passing air vehicles with the focal light

Can be used to magnifying words for reading

Lasts forever if properly used

Reliable if it is sunny

Somewhat impact resistant

Water resistant

Waterproof

Cons:

Not reliable if it is cloudy

Can scratch easily making it unusable

Fire Piston ($24.75) This product is great, and will ignite charcloth using only air! The inside is metal within both pieces, so even if the wood decays during a second lifetime, it will still work! All you have to do is remove the o-ring during non-usage, and apply lubrication during each usage to extend the o-ring life to 5 years each. I bought a bag of the correct sized o-rings, containing 100 pieces for about 6-7 dollars on amazon. So in other words, with proper care from rusting, the product could last for 500 years! Remember to use spit to lubricate!

Pros: Lasts almost forever due to wood protection

Only requires air and charcloth to start a fire

Waterproof

Water resistant

Impact Resistant

Cons:

Possible rusting if unproperly used

Steel Striker for Flint with Bow-Drill Hole ($27.82) This is a very hard tool, and I do not recommend it for beginners. I was unable to start a fire with a rock which gave sparks. This was not possible with flammable substance or charcloth. I have not used the bowdrill, due to the time requirements of using a bow-drill. However, this striker will last a very long time since steel does not erode very easily.

Pros: Can find flint anywhere to be used for the striker

Common stick can be used for the bow-drill hole

Lasts as long as the steel

doesnt erode

Impact resistant

Cons:

Time Consuming

Blisters on your hands

Fire is not likely guaranteed

Replacing old US Navy mummy bag. Need some advice in an unfamiliar brand.,1,iwvaee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iwvaee/replacing_old_us_navy_mummy_bag_need_some_advice/,2,1600699654.0,"TLDR: replacing old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. New target for a nearly year round bang is the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". I know next to nothing about Slumberjack and would love to hear if any one has experience with this specific sleeping bag or one that has the same qualities.

I'm looking to replace my old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. I acquired it in my early teen years and have been stubbornly using it as my go-to sleeping bag for any and all occasion for the past 13-14 years. Whether it be late fall car camping in pretty low temps to backpacking 5-8 miles to the campsite in August... I live in Utah for reference.

Don't get me wrong, I adore this bag and it has held up beyond my wildest expectations. I have never felt too cold while in it, even to the point of sweating when it's snowing outside the tent. It still looks nearly untouched after some rough bush over the past decade. It only learned the pleasure of a protective compression sack this year and still the only sign that it's been used and abused is the ""US NAVY"" on the underside is nearly faded away.

My only gripe is, if my scale is accurate, packed up it weighs just over 13 pounds. That's a lot of weight to be strapped to the bottom of my Mardingtop 65+10L pack going up mountains in 90-100 degree weather. The cold nights where I sit in my tent with my dog bundled up grinning a snarky grin, knowing I'm the most comfy person at the site are no longer worth hauling that mattress around.

After spending most of the day going through any market place I could find online, I believe I have found the bag that match's what I'm wanting nearly exactly. It's still on the heavier side, but cuts down the weight more then half. Also, after using the Navy bag for so long I have grown accustomed to being in my ""nest"" as I'm fond of calling it. 
Only thing that sucks, I have no knowledge or experience with the brand so I'm hesitant to pull the trigger with it sounding to good to be true.

It's the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". Looks to only be sold first hand on their offical website and one of the local Walmarts near me. It hits nearly all of my criteria perfectly, but that's all just from the details on the webpage that seem to very depending on who's selling and where. Seen to many adds boast a total weight only to see the actual weight being a few pounds more or less. 

The few reviews their are don't really hit the points I'm wanting to know and there are no youtube reviews on it at all. If anyone has used this specific sleeping bag or know of any that align with it and are even less weight, I would love to hear about it! 

Thanks for sticking with it till the end!!",survival

There are a lot of home-made lip balm formulas online, but they weren't really what I was looking for.

While they are no doubt just as effective as the store bought stuff, the disadvantage is that they have a limited shelf life.

I wanted to come up with a lip balm base that can be made in bulk and stored pretty much indefinitely.

I began by using formulas available online but substituting perishable ingredients (such as coconut oil) with non-perishable ones.

After some experimentation, I have finally come up with something that I believe is about equal to store bought lip balm sticks, and won't go rancid like the homemade stuff.

As a bonus, the ingredients are simple, cheap, and available pretty much anywhere. Making the stuff is really simple too.

This makes a plain white lip balm base that has no taste or odor. Colors and flavors can be added, but this may decrease the shelf life.

While I was not deliberately aiming for a vegan formulation, it just so happens that none of the ingredients are animal in origin.

Ingredients:

Paraffin wax (sold in supermarkets as canning wax)

Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, though the generic ones are fine)

Mineral oil USP (in the laxative section of the pharmacy)

The formula is 1 part wax, 2 parts petroleum jelly, 3 parts mineral oil measured by weight.

Put the ingredients in a pan and **slowly** warm it on a low heat until it *just* melts. This is the trickiest part. Be careful not to overheat the mixture.

When it is all melted, stir well and pour into a suitable container such as a canning jar for storage.

This is your bulk supply. When you want to use some,  scoop a portion out with a spoon and re-melt it.

The consistency is perfect for filling empty lip balm tubes or small cosmetic pots, which can be bought on Amazon or from most craft stores.

If you want to make a more luxurious version, substitute beeswax instead of paraffin wax.",survival

Emergency Flint & Steel Fire when you have no flint and no steel.,50,iuflr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iuflr8/emergency_flint_steel_fire_when_you_have_no_flint/,16,1600361032.0,"If you don't have a purpose-built steel striker, many other things will work.  Do you have something else that is carbon steel?  Or can you find an old tool in a cellar hole or dump?  Can you salvage a part from a junk car or atv wreck?  Keep an eye out as you walk along the trail for a piece of metal.  But it has to be carbon steel-  not stainless steel, and not soft steel like the typical nail, sheet metal, angle iron, etc.

Is your knife carbon steel?  If not, then what about your ax?  If you're not sure then hit it with a hard rock.

What rocks are available in the area?  Flint or chert is good, if you can find it.  Quartz will also work, along with many other rocks.  Basalt can work if you knap a sharp edge on it.  Granite can work because it has quartz in it.  If you're not a geologist, don't worry.  You don't have to be an expert at identifying rocks.  You just have to locate a hard rock, not one one that is soft or crumbles easily.  Then hit it with your piece of steel.  If you see sparks, you are good to go.  Some steels are better than others for this purpose as are some rocks.  So with a good kit you could be getting gobs of fat sparks.  If your improvised kit is only throwing a few, wimpy sparks, that's ok.  It will likely take a little longer for a spark to hit your tinder and catch, but you can make it happen.  Just keep trying.

What kind of metal objects might work?  We already mentioned axes and knives.  And it's not just fixed blade knives.  Many antique and vintage pocket knives are carbon steel and throw wonderful sparks.  Learn how to identify the satisfying grey of old carbon tool steel.  If you are carrying an ax, you likely have a file to sharpen it.  Most files make great steel strikers.  Chisels often work well.  Hammers can throw sparks.  You should know that many tools are deferentially heat treated.  That means one area is harder than another part of the tool.  The hammer head's striking surface might throw sparks, but not the top.  The file's side might spark, but not the handle.  Pliers and wire cutters can throw sparks and also saw blades and many other tools.  Car parts, motorcycle parts, and other machine components are something to check.  Not everything will work, but you only have to find one thing that does.  Understand that you should clean grease and remove paint and rust from the striking area.  The cleaner it is, the better it will work.

It helps to practice with found rocks in your area, and also with various metal objects.  If you are poor, or unable to source a professionally-made steel striker in your area, you can make your own flint & steel kit.  Simply cut up, or break down the metal object to the size you want.  Find a rock, and knap a sharp edge.  Find some sort of metal tin for charring cloth, punk wood, fungus, and other things.  You're good to go.

Animal attack cheat sheet (for animals found in the PNW),566,itgzez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itgzez/animal_attack_cheat_sheet_for_animals_found_in/,155,1600230526.0,"I frequently go camping, hiking, or otherwise exploring. I‚Äôm insanely anxious and I always overthink my safety, so I‚Äôm sharing with you guys the list of techniques I‚Äôve made to avoid and/or survive attacks by some wild animals that we have here in the PNW.


COUGARS/MOUNTAIN LIONS-

If approached- Do NOT run. Do not turn your back to them, they are ambush predators. Make yourself look bigger to appear threatening. Maintain constant eye contact as you yell, make loud noises, and wave your arms about. Try to scare them off. Again, do NOT run as they will most likely attack.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. Try to remain on your feet and protect your head and neck. Fight back by any means possible. This means punching, kicking, any weapons you may have or nearby objects that can be used as a weapon.


BLACK BEARS-

If you see a black bear, respect its space. They will usually avoid you in turn as they are fairly timid. If you must pass them, give them a wide berth. They would rather flee than fight.

If approached- If you have children in your party, keep them close. Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand and face the bear directly. Speak calmly to identify yourself as something that is not a prey animal. If that does not work, make yourself look larger, and make loud noises to scare the bear away. Avoid direct eye contact.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. If you can escape to a safe location like a car or house, do it, but if not, then fight back. Black bears will not leave you alone if you play dead. Concentrate kicks and blows to the bear‚Äôs face and snout.


GRIZZLY BEARS-

If you see cubs, slowly back away. They are cute and may actually be intrigued by you, but do not interact since mama bear is probably close by and will certainly kick your ass. 

If approached- Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand tall and make yourself look large. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it is most likely just curiosity. Slowly back away with your bear spray in your hand. Ideal spraying distance is 40-50 feet.

If attacked- Lay down and do NOT fight back. This will intensify the attack as the bear is usually trying to neutralize you as a threat. Assume a fetal position, protecting your stomach with your knees, and lace your fingers behind your neck to protect it. If the bear stops attacking, stay ‚Äúdead‚Äù for at least 15-20 minutes because it will linger to see if you‚Äôre dead or just injured. If the bear is gone, back away slowly rather than running just in case they are watching from a distance. If the attack persists after you‚Äôve played dead, fight back only as a last resort, and aim for the bear‚Äôs eyes and snout.


WOLVERINE-

Wolverines have a reputation for being scary, but they are more likely to just throw a tantrum in order to scare you since bluffing is their forte. They are also not large- similar to a medium sized dog.

You will rarely encounter these in the wild since they are shy and solitary creatures. As far as I know, there are no cases of wolverines attacking humans. Just go back the way you came, or if you continue, give them space and keep an eye out. It‚Äôs unlikely that they‚Äôll hurt you.


PORCUPINE-

Porcupines are not often seen in the daytime as they are nocturnal and timid. They are short sighted and easily startled, so if you encounter a porcupine, walk a large distance around it if possible. They may swish their tail around which makes a strange noise, but unless you scare or threaten them, they are unlikely to quill you.

If quilled- remove them as quickly as possible so that the swelling doesn‚Äôt make it harder. Cut off the long end so that you can get a good grip on it and tug on it. If you can, do not twist or break it off. Do not use bare hands because this can injure your hand as well. If possible, wash the wounds well with soap and water and then apply antibiotic cream. Watch the wounds for redness, swelling, or itching. If you are quilled in the face or if the quills will not come out, see a doctor.

Encounter with a Mama (Black) Bear,162,itdxzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itdxzx/encounter_with_a_mama_black_bear/,59,1600221465.0,"Hello I was recently hiking on the Coast in the Pacific Northwest and had a close encounter with a Mama black bear and two cubs.


I was hiking and saw a few fellow hikers yelling and whistling at something in the distance. A moment later I saw the outline of a bear on the beach zig zagging back and forth from the water to the forest line. The hikers said the Mama bear and cubs came out behind them from the woods. We watched for a second before realizing the bears were still coming towards us.¬†


We began yelling, using the emergency whistles we had on us, banging our hiking poles loudly over head, and saying ""hey bear!"" in a loud voice. Nothing seemed to stop her.


Figuring if we gave her ample space she would pass, or retreat into the woods. Unfortunately we backed (slowly) towards the water to let her pass (she had about 75 yards of beach to safely pass) instead she stopped, and made a 90 degree turn straight at us.


Once we realized she was walking right at us and wasn't stopping, and the only way out was to go swimming or try to climb a sea stack and having forgotten my bear spray in the car, I pulled out my pistol and fired once into the air (towards the ocean) . To our surprise the cubs ran but mama just stopped and stared.¬† We then fired twice more and she ran. Once she took off I decided wading through the water would be the safest and fastest way out.¬†


Less than five minutes later she was back on the beach in the same spot where we had fired the shots.


I know bears like to bluff to get you to back down, however since we were stuck with our backs toward the ocean with nowhere to retreat, would she have attacked had she gotten closer?¬†


Also lesson learned I won't be forgetting my bearspray again.¬†All my life I've heard, ""bears are more scared of you then you are of them"", that really diddnt seem to be the case, she brazenly walked towards 5 of us being big, and loud which diddnt have any effect on her whatsoever.

I've never really done any actual training, though I plan to do so if I ever get the chance, but I've watched enough outings and camping trips and I've seen enough so that I'm confident I could make it about a week in the bush if I packed properly. 

But I want to get more into the foraging and making herbal medicines and what not. If anyone has any recommendations for a beginner, that would be awesome. 

I prefer the primitive techniques, and the minimalist approach to bug out and survival, but I don't know of any authors or anything like that.

3) You shouldn't eat when you are really thirsty, drinking water is more important.  

4) Apples help prevent you from getting thirsty.  

5) If you get really lost, follow the stars at night to the North Star. This will lead you home.  

6) Don't try to walk in a straight line. There are better ways to do this.  

7) Find a river. These are easier to find your way back from.  

8) Try to pollinate flowers when you are lost, as this will help you find your way back home.

9) If you have no water and are finding your way home, look for railroad tracks to the East. This is the quickest way home.  

10) If you are lost for more than 2 days, look for a light spot on the horizon. This could be a town and if you reach it, you will find your way from there.",survival

And other hikers told me I am an idiot. It's pounds of additional weight for nothing. And I did not give a shit. Better be prepared, just in case.

Last week my gf slipped on a tricky descent in the mountains. She broke her leg in 2 places and tore a ligament (she is actually in surgery right now and will get some screws into her leg to fix the bones). I set her down, put the warm clothes on her when she started shivering and went into shock. I gave her pain killers and the go-pills to get her up again. I cut down a small tree to make a walking aid and put a stick on her leg with the bandages to immobilize it. Then we spend an hour moving down the mountain, little by little, until we got to a clearing with cell phone reception and could call for help. She was evacuated by chopper.

A little help with snowy survival...,4,ilkih8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ilkih8/a_little_help_with_snowy_survival/,15,1599127008.0,"I'll preface this by saying that none of the information I'm looking for is for practical / real life use. I'm working on a writing project and I'm finding that I wish I knew more about certain wilderness survival skills. With that being said...

&#x200B;

I'm working on a piece of writing that takes place in a very cold and snowy environment. My main character has been living in isolation, off the land for some amount of time. The climate isn't arctic but there are several feet of snow (at least) year round. There are plenty of trees (coniferous stuff) and lots of animals (both dangerous and not). In my head I'm picturing a colder version of the old growth forests of the pacific northwest in America. 

My main character survives by foraging and trapping I think, but I'm not fully sure how reasonable this is. I suppose my first question is: can a person survive, on their own, in conditions like I've described? 

What I'm trying to figure out specifically is what my main character's day-to-day looks like. What is the best method for building a semi-permanent shelter? What are some of the biggest dangerous to look out for that aren't immediately intuitive? Obviously I know that she is going to need to keep warm and fed, but are there other implications of the setting and environment that I'm not thinking of?

I like the idea of her getting a decent chunk of her daily food from traps she set, but I have absolutely no experience with designing, building, or setting traps. Any guidance at all on this topic would be super appreciated. 

My setting is post-apocalyptic sci-fi so I've got some wiggle room when it comes to what technology is available but obviously providing power to any kind of tech will be a hurdle, especially without a whole lot of sun. I already have a few fun ideas like a hovering pod to store food in so that bears can't get to it, but most of those details are being ironed out after I figure out the limits of snowy survival. 

My experience in this stuff begins and ends with digging out and sleeping in a snow cave when I was in boy scouts. I've been backpacking in warmer climates and my family growing up was pretty outdoorsy, but I'm just feeling a little lost on the living-off-the-land-in-a-never-ending-winter thing.

"Secrets to finding flint in areas where experts say there is no flint. It's a good survival skill to have- The ability to pick up a rock and make a tool, or use it to make fire. Flint and chert are highly prized for this. But what if you live in an area where ‚Äúeveryone says‚Äù there is none?",356,ihm6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ihm6yj/secrets_to_finding_flint_in_areas_where_experts/,31,1598567955.0,"One example is where I live-  New Hampshire, US.  Most of the sources say that there is no flint or chert to be found here.  The reason for that statement is that the sedimentary rock was scoured away by glaciers, and is now out in the ocean somewhere.  Almost all flint and chert is biological in origin, so it's found in sedimentary rock such as limestone.  There is no sedimentary bedrock here, so therefore no flint (or so they claim).  That statement is true, but only in a general sense.  You will not find it in the bedrock or exposed ledge.  You won't find large deposits of it.  But you can find it in the woods, and here are a few secrets -

Those same glaciers that scoured away our sedimentary bedrock also brought in rocks from far away.  Because of this one geologist wrote that you might find just about any kind of rock in New Hampshire.  The context was he was writing to the general public.  It wasn't a formal paper to fellow academics.  Still, his general observation was an amazing variety of rocks, so he wrote that you might find almost any kind of rock here.  And I would say this applies to a very large area, not only the small state of New Hampshire.  I believe that most of the North American continent was covered by glaciers at one time.  That means that flint or chert may have been brought there by glaciers from far away.

Where should you look for chert?  Look in stream and creek beds.  Ones with a fast current are better because it tends to keep the rocks clean from algae, moss, and other vegetation.  Also look alongside the trail and along the road.  Let's face it-  It's much easier to find rocks on the surface of the ground than dig for them.  Mining is a lot of work, obviously.  When you find a rock that you suspect to be chert, you may have to break it open in order to identify it.

Another place to look for chert is along old Indian trails and areas settled by them.  One way that rocks move is by being carried by humans.  The American Indians had an extensive trade network, and one commodity was chert.  Many roads and trails in the US were originally Indian trails.  Some of these can be found in old records.  But most (I believe) you would have to find by talking to people or knowing how to recognize them.  You can also learn to identify likely settlements.  This topic I plan to address later.

The last secret I want to go over today is finding lost or discarded gun flints.  Poor people used flintlocks in rural areas long after the invention of percussion firearms and even cartridge ammunition.  So you might find flint in and around old cellar holes, and also in hunting areas.  Certain vantage points have always been good for hunting with a firearm.  If you see a tree stand, spent casings, etc on a ridge if you look carefully you might find flint as well.

Before I sign off, I would like to thank Jay of Vision Quest Outdoors for his help.  I also thank him for challenging me to go out and find chert in the woods.  Check out his Youtube channel if you get a chance.

I hope this helps you.  I also want to give you a challenge.  I'm calling it Chert Quest 2020.  Go out and try to find chert in your area, especially if it is an area where people say it doesn't exist.

God bless!

‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù story,26,ifrozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ifrozt/survival_story/,7,1598313460.0,"
So here‚Äôs a little survival story from last year. It is a story of failure and success. Like with everything in the woods there were many teaching moments but I do believe that the most important thing for me that I learned is that in the end the most important tool you posses is your mind.

In May last year I took off in my kayak alone for about 5 days on Delaware River. I was planning to do about 80 miles and camp along the way. Mind you I do 30-40 mile trips on that river every month from April till November so I‚Äôm fairly familiar with the waters as well as with my boat. I had about 5 days worth of food and most of my equipment is fairly new as my wife does good deal of backpacking so whenever something better and lighter comes out she passes her old gear to me. Everything is in watertight bags and stored either inside of the kayak or strapped to the top. I have multiple means of making fire, tools, etc etc...

From the begging it‚Äôs a rough start. It rained non stop for 2 weeks and waters are little elevated. Again nothing new there so I hop in with my life jacket on and start cruising. Thing is I‚Äôm going way to fast, dogging dead trees that current picked up from the shores because of elevated waters. I knock almost twenty five  miles of my trip in 4 hours and I‚Äôm not even tired. I keep on taking water but not much and I write it off as on and off showers and waves. Out of the sudden water keeps rising and I feel a surge of current so I decide to stop for a quick meal but every suitable site I know is either under water or banks are so steep I can‚Äôt climb them. On top of that it started pouring again and now I‚Äôm just looking to get out and set up camp. Finally I find a place. It‚Äôs little steep but it can be done. I see bottom about one foot down. I nose my kayak in and wedge it into a strainer that is on the side of the river and jump out. I realize I misjudged the depth and with one leg out and another one still inside I fall over tilting my kayak. Within seconds my boat is full of water and I‚Äôm pinned at my chest against the strainer. Cords on top of the boat get wet and loose and gear shifts and starts floating way. Food that was packed in the front of the boat also shifts and falls out and after few seconds of floating sinks. This is part of the adventure right? I try pushing the kayak off my chest and dive underneath to finally get free. My first priority is to secure the boat but now filled with water and sideways it is almost impossible. I manage to flip it outright and it still floats due to some gear being in the waterproof bags. I grab my tow rope and climb ashore and secure the boat to the tree. I look down river and see my waterproof pack caught on another strainer so I run quickly to get it. I run thru the bushes on the bank of the river, jump in but misjudge the strength of the current so I miss the pack. I climb to the shore and try again. This time I‚Äôm lucky. At this point I‚Äôm cold as temps are in the low 50s and water is pretty freezing. As I‚Äôm walking back to the camp I hear a tearing sound and see my kayak floating away. I jump in to intercept it and steer it onto the bank of the river. Tilt it over and pour the water out than remove the dry bags. Hauling to boat up to the high ground in the mud I realized that handles I used to secure the rope to my boat got torn away. Finally I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm cold, wet and need to change into something dry, get the inventory going and evaluate the situation. I pile up all the gear I have left and stretch up a tarp over me to work away from the rain. All I‚Äôm dreaming about is some dry clothes and fire. Here‚Äôs another snafu: all my nice gear inside the waterproof bags is wet and so are all my belongings in the waterproof pack. How is this possible? Well I‚Äôve been using them bags and pack for the last ten years. They‚Äôve seen their fair share of abuse and between that, wear and tear and degradation they were maybe sprinkle proof but not submersion proof. Everything I have is soaking wet except for my boots which I managed to put in the garbage bag. Most of my food is gone but I have enough, plus there is enough water to boil and I have my stove except that there is something wrong with the stove because I soon as I screw it onto the gas canister it starts leaking. Trying to change the oring with cold shaky hands is nearly impossible but I manage but the stove still leaks. Ok it‚Äôs a problem but I got 3 different ways to start the fire so I‚Äôm not worried. I go to collect wood and I realized that I must be in a pretty popular place to camp as within 200 yards I‚Äôm not finding much of the dead fall wood and besides that everything is wet. I keep trying for an hour trying to get the fire going but I can‚Äôt. I have a Randal survival knife with back up fire starter and kindling in the handle except water got in there and them little kindlings are wet as well. Anytime fire catches a bit it dies out quickly. Now I‚Äôm really cold, it‚Äôs getting dark, I‚Äôm still wet and hungry. I look at the river, now at the highest point I saw in 10 years and where the strainer was that I originally pulled in I see a floating porta-potty and next to it there is a plastic bag with some of my food (ramen noodles and some buns). I tie of the rope to myself and swim up grab the bag and as I‚Äôm ready to pull myself back the ports potty shifts door open and I get covered in feces. Thank god for strong current because most of it floats away quickly. As I‚Äôm ready to leave I see a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall of the ports potty and pull it off. I half swim half drag myself back to the camp. I strip naked and set off to again collect the fire wood (which later on led to poison ivy in bad places) and haul as much as I can. Again I try my hand at the fire but this time twigs are coated with hand sanitizer from the porta-john. Fire catches and I start feeding it and before I know it I have this huge roaring fire. It also stoped raining so I set up the cloth and gear drying lines all around. I get a pot of water from the river and start boiling it throwing ramen in there with whatever other stuff I could find. It‚Äôs dark now but some of my clothes are dry enough to wear. I continue rotating gear on the lines so it dries evenly and before midnight my tent and pad are dry enough. Sleeping bag not so much. I take the tarp and angle it down by the fire and create an improvised lean to shelter and spread my pad. My fleece and jacket are also dry so that will do for a night. I fall asleep waking up every few hours to add more wood to the fire. Miserable night but I‚Äôm dry and sort of warm. In the morning sun comes out but it‚Äôs still cold. Fire is still going strong, things that were wet are still wet but I‚Äôm in good spirits. I know where I am and after going over my food I know I have enough.. It‚Äôs not going to be gourmet meals I was planning but it‚Äôs all good. I plan to spend the day at that site, getting things dry. While inspecting the boat I find a hole by the rear that was created by years of dragging the kayak on pavement ramps. I find a pine tree and collect some sap and force it into the crack and cover it with duct tape. Day went uneventful consisting of collecting fire wood, turning gear over and by the end of it my sleeping bag was dry and I got some decent sleep. Day 3 in the morning water started to recede a bit but it was still fast. I pack the kayak not realizing that I made it little bit too top heavy and when hopping in again I slip and flip it over again. Thank god I packed everything I couldn‚Äôt afford to get wet like my sleeping bag, pad, boots and spare clothing into the garbage bag and than slid it into the worthless waterproof sack to prevent the garbage bag from tearing. I‚Äôm laughing because I haven‚Äôt flipped in many years and now it‚Äôs twice in 3 days. I drain the boat, redistribute the weight and hop in. Water is still fast so I knock first ten miles in an hour and a half when it starts raining and that changes into the downpour. At this point I‚Äôm like screw this and made the decision to go all way to the end and get in my car. Between current and paddling I got there within 6 or 7 hours. Hauled my kayak to the back of my car, called a local camping place about 30 miles away and rented a cabin for two nights. On the way there I swung by Wally World and got some dry clothes and food. That was the end. The reason I‚Äôm sharing this story now is because on my recent trip as I stepped on the bank of the river I realized I was wearing the same clothes as during that faithful trip last year. 

Now it was a learning and humbling experience. Mistakes such as gear negligence, overconfidence in equipment and skills that were rusty were corrected later that summer. I realized that even thou I‚Äôm in my kayak all the time I rarely practiced any emergency procedures so I got to work on that. My broken down defective gear was replaced with newer one that is inspected regularly. I looked for solutions on how to better pack my kayak and found a lot of helpful suggestions which I implemented and as for fire well that‚Äôs a work in progress but that‚Äôs something I practice a lot and I‚Äôm getting better. Still I pack redundant ways of making fire and every chance I get I start it with a method that I don‚Äôt yet feel comfortable. Holes in my kayak were repaired with fiberglass.

Now as far as how really of the survival situation that was. Well not gonna lie I could have called for help as the river has rangers patrolling it and even thou I don‚Äôt know if they would come out in that weather that was a lifeline. I had no cell signal at the place I was in but pretty sure a short hike would have changed that. I knew exactly where I was and which way the local road was so I could have hiked out if needed abandoning most of my gear. I wasn‚Äôt hurt except for my pride. I considered hiking to the road but after starting the fire and getting some food everything seemed ok and the situation was just a case of bad luck. Now as far as the water surges and levels are concerned it happened due to rains which caused multiple damm releases. When I pulled into the place I was met with the ranger who told me I shouldn‚Äôt been on the river and company that transported my kayak should have told me that as warnings were sent out. Due to my bath with feces I called my doc but since I have hep a/b shots due to my work that Is checked yearly he told me I will be ok. In the end thank you for reading this enjoy and have good laugh at my expense.",survival

Knife is for sure required, but I have my folding knife. Is the belt knife necessary if I have a hatchet (for splitting wood)?

Can't get a decent machete here, but I have a banana knife that does the same job (thin curved blade on a 2 ft handle). Only job it does that the others don't do well is cutting brush or use as a weapon. It's beveled on only one side so it sucks for splitting

Saw for cutting trees and bamboo and crafting. Actually wouldn't consider NOT bringing both a fine toothed and coarse toothed blade.

Hatchet? Can baton with the belt knife (belt knife would work better for bamboo in fact), can cut trees with the saw. Only thing I can think of is splitting solid wood, and I don't imagine myself doing that much. 

Had a really thick local-style machete, but it sucks at everything. The point is curved like you'd use it to stab which makes it terrible for chopping, it's too thick so it won't cut brush, the balance sucks so it's not great for fighting either (I imagine). Only thing it does better than anything else is batoning (the balance sucks so bad that I wouldn't even want to try chopping by swinging the damn thing). The steel is so hard I can't even sharpen it with a file, but it throws sparks pretty easily I guess.",survival

In my kit list I am looking to add a multitool (Leatherman) and a standard lock knife made from good steel.

Opinel knives have always done the job for me. The high carbon steel means the blade holds it's edge well. They are cheap and replaceable. But I wanted to know if any survival veterans on here have tested them out thoroughly? Just in case there is a better recommendation out there.

Perhaps combine one of these options with a rugged tarp to make a warm/weatherproof bivy or simple A-frame tent setup?

- I am NOT looking for a very lightweight mylar/space blanket
- Sleeping bag suggestions are welcome. I just feel all sleeping 
  bags, even expensive ones, will be bulkier and heavier than a more

As one of the adults I suggested tarps and hammocks.  I covered a mock setup at one of our last meetings in my back yard and since setting that tarp up, I've done a bit of work to make up a kit for the scouts to put together for their personal gear.

I've put together a fastrope system for the ridge line, making use of a bowline with a bite on the loop end, storing 2 shorter prusiks on the fastrope, which then gets rolled into the tarp, securing the package with 2 more semi-adjustable loops using fisherman's knots to form the loop and give these a little adjustability for roll size.  Not all the boys have the hand/arm strength to get these rolled super tight.  These two loops will be used for additional prusics, as needed.

Most of them don't have the cash to fork over for a ulta-lightweight fly, so most will be rolling with 9x9's or 9x11 foot harbor freight blue tarps.  Watching some videos yesterday, I saw someone suggested running the ridge line above the tarp.  I kinda like this idea and will use toggles and prusik knots and toggles to tension the tarp to the ridge  line.  This may change how we deploy lights inside the tarp though.  I'm also suggesting to the scouts to make use of a drip line and other water blocks on the hammock straps.

Looking for other suggestions to keeping the boys dry.  Saturday looks to be a complete washout :)  Can't wait. I will have a backup tent (6 person coleman tube  as a backup in case the whole hammock thing turns into a swimming lesson.  This thing is massive inside and will serve well for my 2 boys and myself if we need it.

As mentioned, I am a professional photographer. I just got into ""survival style camping"" and will be going out over a weekend soon into the wilderness.

My survival backpack I built is extremely light, I was able to make a backup with EVERYTHING you can think of including an entire fishing set and grill for under 35 lbs. I put a lot of time and research into building a very lightweight set up. I live in a warm climate so I was able to get away without needing a lot of gear for warmth. Now the question is the camera. I shoot with a Nikon D750 normally. That plus the lens alone are extremely heavy, not to mention all of the other gear. I am wondering if there are other pro photographers out there who have found a camera that is lightweight with a lens such as the 24-70mm f2.8 range that is able to capture raw images for post-processing later. I am very hesitant to take my set up as it is too heavy and bulky. I was thinking about maybe the mirrorless Z series from Nikon, but with the lens on it, I am not sure if it gets much lighter.

Eldorado national forest trip report,5,hd2424,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hd2424/eldorado_national_forest_trip_report/,14,1592749765.0,"I took a trip with another friend of mine into eldorado national forest. We stayed from the 13th-20th of June. I brought in 15,100 calories of food in total. I brought a garmin inreach mini satellite messenger, bear bag, clothes, tarp, rain gear, sleep system, a knife, and a multitool and other miscellaneous items. I am a wilderness first and have been practicing survival skills for a long time. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the trip by day.

Day 1: Dropped off. My own carelessness and not checking google maps which I had downloaded a map of the area on was a mistake. If I did we‚Äôd have realized that the directions we had found to get to this area were not good. We wasted 45 minutes of walking before I checked out of suspicion that we weren‚Äôt even near the trailhead. We were about ten miles or so of walking on highways away from it. So I drop some pins marking a path to walk to the trailhead but it‚Äôs still some distance to cover given it‚Äôs already about 2 pm, so we walked as far as we could to get there. We stopped walking at about 4 by a big creek and set up camp. We were still many miles off from our destination. 2 important details to mention are that I collected some mullein (non native to the area and grows a lot by roads) on the walk in and also that my left boot got wet crossing the river to hang up the bear bag. 

Day 2: We had planned to get up early so we can rush to our destination. My left boot was wet so I was unable to walk with it on, because even in the summer the morning air and the water of that boot were super cold for my left foot. I opted to walk in three layers of socks until it warmed up and could put on the shoes bearably. Don‚Äôt let your shoes get wet, people. We eventually arrive and go to set up cam, trying several different locations trying to find a good spot. Eventually we find one that is somewhat close to the lake but is maybe 40 feet  above it with an easy route down. I assumed that the increase in elevation and relative dryness of that spot would mean few mosquitos and boy was I wrong. The mosquitos were very annoying and made me regret not bringing a mosquito net which would have weighed nothing. Also, when I went to fill my water bladder, I heard a rattling noise and after a second I realize that‚Äôs a rattler and back away from the noise. I saw him going under a log about 15 feet away from me after I had vigorously backed away. This was a mildly terrifying experience but it was reassuring he seemed to be on the defensive and that he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I ended up seeing a number of other snakes during this trip including a California striped racer, 2 sierra gartners and another snake I can‚Äôt remember the name of.

Days 3 and 4: Here‚Äôs where Id have to start looking into my notebook because around here the days start blurring together. I remember being very low on energy, until I had taken my first dump of the trip. i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of that or because I wasn‚Äôt eating enough but I digress. I taught my friend several different deadfall trap variations, including the paiute (really good with how high friction the granite there is), the figure 4, and the sam sea. We did not set any unattended or bait any and were just fucking with them for fun. Doing this and attempting to drop a coal on the bow drill (once again for fun because fires were not permitted) made me realize how bad the materials you have to work with can be. Nothing I tried would work for bow drill, aspen, sierra juniper, doug fir, I even tried pine because I wanted the coal so badly, and none of it worked. All of the wood would gloss up super quickly even if I knew it to be a good wood for friction fire. or it would pass the thumbnail test. Also at this point I realized I had fucked up in leaving my chapstick at home because my lips were giant black scabs at this point.

Day 5: Remeber that mullein I mentioned earlier? Well I did a hand drill on an incense cedar hearth board with it and it was amazing. Dropped 2 coals with this combo where bow drill had completely failed me. On the drive out I stopped the car to take home some more mullein (once again not a native plant) for practice at home. 

Day 6: On this day my friend and I use his John Muir Law‚Äôs guide to sierra nevada to identify all different kinds of organisms to make a species list. That was pretty fun and a good way to kill time because time at this point had started to drag a bit. I took a swim in the lake. My friend and I made a giant ass paiute deadfall for fun. That was pretty much it.

Day 7: at this point Im just really bored of messing with paiutes and my hands are fucked up from paiute deadfalls/granite/handdrill so there wasn‚Äôt a ton to do outside of just relax and try to observe nature and take it in. A technique I like to use called a silent sit or a sit spot which is essentially just sitting in a spot and trying to observe nature and eventually animals will come close to you and start coming out of hiding. I spent roughly 2 hours in one spot just admiring my last full day there. This was the worst night in terms of mosquitos. 

Day 8. Hiked out to our pick up spot. I packed up a few primitive skills materials, my favorite paiute, and some hearthboards I had made from incense cedar sticks from the ground. Our ride was a bit late so we hiked down the road towards it to get to a main road in hopes of getting service because the garmin inreach was all but dead. Luckily our ride appeared while we were hiking back. 

**TL;DR/takeaways**
Use your modern technology to your advantage. Vague instructions from the forest service and other parties can fuck you over. 

Bring chapstick. 

Bring some kind of way of dealing with bugs. 

Don‚Äôt let your boots get wet, or any piece of clothing for that matter. 

You will have a lot of down time and I‚Äôd imagine in a survival situation you‚Äôd be trying to save energy or make things that are  useful while hiding from the elements. 

I probably should have brought sunscreen.

Take advantage of resources as you pass them when it is ethical to do so. 

You won‚Äôt always have good materials so traps like the figure 4 which seem pretty dependent on good materials have a severe disadvantage to something you can make which mediocre materials like the paiute. 

Make sure you know what to do with venomous snakes.

Bears!,249,hcycbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hcycbt/bears/,70,1592732645.0,"I originally wrote this as a comment to another post. There are so many posts on here about ""I'm new to the wilderness what's up with bears?"" I figured I'd post this as it's own sticky post. This is geared towards new people and there are exceptions to most of what I say. Nothing is gospel in survival. Even the best trained and most experienced outdoorsmen sometimes come home in body bags. I would love to hear from anyone about mistakes I made or things I left out, although remember this is a post targeted at beginners so it's main aim is to give people a set of basic, easy to follow guidelines to minimize the chance of being injured or killed by a bear.

Now, here is my comment, repurposed as this post:

When you see a bear give them a big hug, they are famous for hugging!

Seriously though, wild camping is actually a very very safe hobby. Considering the amount of people that take to the wild every year it's not actually that big of a deal to camp in bear country. Black bears are by far the most common bears to encounter. Between 1997 and 2017 there were 25 fatal black bear attacks in North America https://www.wideopenspaces.com/list-fatal-black-bear-attacks-north-america-last-20-years/ and also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America To put that in context, in just Yellowstone National Park in only the year 2018 there were 4.1 million visitors. The best place to start for safety in bear country in the US is here: https://www.nps.gov/articles/bearattacks.htm The most comprehensive book is still *Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance* by Herrero https://www.amazon.com/Bear-Attacks-Their-Causes-Avoidance/dp/149302941X

Basically there are 3 rules.

1st give them their space.

2nd don't mess with their cubs.

Those are obvious.

The 3rd and most important one is food. The vast majority of adults who get hurt by black bears do so because the bear was seeking the person's food and the person got hurt in the process. Make 3 separate spots: one for camping/sleeping one for cooking one for food storage. Don't bring food into your campsite or cook in your campsite. If possible the cooking and food storage sites should be downwind of the campsite so that the bear doesn't wander through your camp seeking your food. This may not be possible in areas with variable winds. Hang up your food or use a bear canister. If you hang your food don't just lazily hang it over a tree branch. Use two pieces of cordage tied to the food bag and suspend the bag at least 15' above the ground and 10' from either tree, by tying a rock to each piece of cordage and tossing it over a branch and then hoisting the bag up. Hang all smelly stuff, not just food: toothpaste sunscreen etc.

Here's a pic of what I mean from a duckduckgo search https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hang+bear+bag&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outsidebozeman.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Flarge%2Fpublic%2FBearBag.jpg%3Fitok%3D_xfgGO_O

There's other ways of doing it but that's the best one. The PCT method is 2nd best. Hang your bear bag in an area that is surrounded by open spaces so you can see whether or not the food is still hanging that way you don't walk up on them while they are munching on your GORP. Even with all the tricks I gave bears still mights get your food because they are real smart. Bear canisters or certain models of UrSak are probably the best overall but are expensive and bulky and don't hold much. You could always just store your food in your car.

If you encounter a black bear on the trail and it doesn't run away (or more likely meander away grumbling to itself) first option is to make yourself big and obvious, wave your arms, yell, etc. ***DO NOT RUN AWAY OR TURN YOUR BACK***. If you encounter a grizzly bear yelling and waving may provoke a defensive attack; look around to try to spot any cubs (you want to move away from the cubs not towards them and when startled the cubs may freeze, being furry and brown they are not that obvious) then back away slowly while keeping the bear in sight. Do not look the bear in the eyes. If the bear charges just throw it your backpack so it can have your food. Seriously. You can buy more Clif Bars. It's not worth getting injured or killed. If the bear is charging and throwing your backpack doesn't work then stand your ground. Use your bear spray or firearm if you have it ready. ***DO NOT RUN FROM A CHARGING BEAR***. Most charges are bluffs, running from a bluff may change the bluff attack into a real one. After the bear bluff charges return to backing away while keeping the hear in sight. Refer to my later section for differences between blacks and grizzlies regarding actual attacks.

Guns and bear spray are good options for defense if you are attacked. Of the two bear spray is objectively superior even among seasoned firearms users. For most people carrying a gun in the woods is more dangerous than any bear. However if you are experienced in handling and utilizing firearms they can be good options. If you aren't I would recommend against it. Neither are necessary if all you've got is black bears but they still might be wise depending on the bear activity in your particular area. In grizzly country you should carry bear spray even if you carry a firearm: either bear spray alone or bear spray + gun. When carrying bear spray do not carry it in your backpack. Carry it in a holster that you can access with one hand without looking at it. Practice drawing the bear spray from it's holster and presenting it several times before each trip so you can discover any problems, for example if it gets caught in your shirt or if it gets covered by your backpack's waist belt you need to address that. Practice while wearing your full kit and the clothes you hike in.

In black bear country .357 mag is the preferred choice among most. In grizzly country  it's classically been .44 mag but the current trend is toward 10mm. Most bear attacks that have been stopped by firearms have been stopped by 9mm using self defense rounds, simply because 9mm is the most common pistol caliber people carry for self defense. There are several recorded instances of grizzly bears being killed with .22lr.

If you are attacked by a black bear it's likely predatory so fight back with everything you have. Even if it's only your fists. If you are attacked by grizzly bears it's likely defensive so play dead by assuming the fetal position and covering your neck and head with your arms and hands as best you can.

I really don't like bear bells. There is no evidence they work and they scare off all the other wildlife and ruin it for other hikers. Major outdoor educators such as NOLS and Outward Bound have done away with bear bells in their classes even in grizzly country. The better option is to educate yourself about bears, and move deliberately and be observant. Don't let yourself get lulled into just mindlessly plodding down the trail. Every once and awhile stop and observe your surroundings. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Remember, it's better to heed that ""not right"" feeling and find out the feeling was wrong than to ignore that ""not right"" feeling and find out it was right.

As for snooping around your campsite? Yeah they're gonna do that regardless they are real curious. If you are out long enough a bear WILL come into your camp probably at night and you won't know it. If you don't have anything that interests them they'll nose around a bit then leave. A fun exercise is to clear all the debris from around your shelter, dig up the dirt a bit so it's nice and fluffy, then smooth it out so the dirt is still soft but very even. Then when you wake up you can see the tracks of all the critters that came to say hi. There will be many tracks, mostly rodents, and eventually, yes, bears.

And please remember that in wild nature, energy is precious so by and large the animals are not out to get you because in most places hunting humans is more trouble than it's worth so animals don't do it. Of course you should take precautions -that's why I'm writing this- but don't let caution become paranoia because that can ruin your experience.

Finally, the best piece of advice is that if you see a bear in the wild (and are not attacked) consider yourself lucky. Bears are really really cool animals and vital parts of the ecosystem.",survival

It's got me thinking about possible survival applications. For example as a coating on the outside of a container as an inverted type of solar oven on a clear sunny day (solar oven tends to direct the light to cook, this would be an absorption into the container).

He stumbles and falls - gets separated from the guides - into one of the rainwater deposits, but can climb out without much problem, but he'll need to spend the night before he could get out.

**The question is: in the situation described above which is more viable to avoid hypothermia?**

**A:** get out of his drenched clothing, wring it out then put back on and rely on his body heat to be trapped by the waterproof jacket or

**B:** get out of his drenched clothing and don't get them back on for the night?

I'm kind of split between the options because I've been in situations where I had to spend a full day in drenched clothing somewhere around 15¬∞C (69¬∞F) in constant rain, but either I had shelter that was dry or had fire, but this scenario is underground, in a constantly wet/damp/humid environment without the possibility of lighting fire.

Trip Report -- Backpacking in Arizona's Rim Country,7,h02sn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/h02sn4/trip_report_backpacking_in_arizonas_rim_country/,8,1591788190.0,"https://reddit.com/link/h02sn4/video/pewmd96l40451/player

I backpacked into a remote area of Arizona, planning ""about"" seven to nine days, starting the Memorial Day Weekend. As it turned out, the trip was six days, and it was an example of knowing when to nope out that I'll get into in a bit.

I'm being deliberately vague about the location of this canyon. It's remote enough, and challenging enough, that I almost never see people. I'd like to keep it that way. For remote places like this I figure the price of admission is finding it yourself.

It's north of Arizona's Mogollon Rim, at an elevation of about 6500 feet. There is perennial water (and lots of it), and an impressive amount of wildlife.

Note that I was purposely taking it very easy on this trip. I'd done something unpleasant to my back about three weeks before, and didn't want to aggravate the injury. Also, I was more interested in exploring the area than I was in putting in lots of miles. This region has a rich history dating back 5000 years (prehistoric Native Americans) and all the way to the modern day, with ranching starting in the 1800s and CCC work in the 1930s, so there's lots of stuff to find.

The first day, I hiked in about a mile and set up camp at an old campground. The campground is long abandoned -- it was built by the CCC and was gone to ruins in the 80s when I first saw it. It still has a picnic table, some foundations, and the remnants of road leading into it, but isn't on any maps and isn't used for camping except by the occasional backpacker.

However, it was a three day weekend, and right after I set up, a family with mom, dad, teenage daughter and daughter's boyfriend appeared -- first time in about five years (and about 20 trips, including other three day weekends) that I've run into anyone else in the area. They were fly fishing, catching crawdads for dinner, and having a good time while. However, I decided to move a bit farther up the canyon the next day. I wanted solitude and they said they were coming back daily to fish for a few more days.

The following morning, I hiked about another two miles up the canyon, and ran across my first rattlesnake in the middle of the trail, having a sunbath. I was alertly watching for snakes as the conditions were perfect, so I saw him first and shoo'd him off the trail with the end of a trekking pole.

I also saw the first of several small groups of turkeys. In the late morning I made camp on a sand bar (there was zero chance of flooding), and poked around a bit. The sandbar was not an ideal campsite, however, as the sand was fine silty crap that was getting in everything. Also, once the morning breezes died down there were black flies everywhere and -- when the wind shifted that evening -- there was a very strong scent of both skunk and carrion. It was too late in the day to move camp when things got stinky, so I sucked it up for the night.

As a side note, in most canyons you can plan on up-canyon winds during the day and down-canyon winds at night. The only time this isn't true is when a strong weather system is coming through.

The next day I found the source of the dead animal stink about a hundred yards up the canyon -- a large bull elk that had been reduced to bones, scraps, and a very bad lingering smell. I looked for the skull, but didn't find it.

I moved another mile and a half up the canyon that day. Saw another rattlesnake while hiking, plus several other non-poisonous snakes.

The third camp was on a bench overlooking a nice series of pools of water. It was high enough to catch a breeze (so fewer biting insects) and there was a nice carpet of pine needles under some of the biggest ponderosas I've ever seen. I made camp, washed my clothes, got cleaned up myself, and lazed about.

The fourth day I day-hiked up the canyon several miles and saw rattlesnake #3 on a sunny rock. He took off in a hurry and swam across the creek. I also saw more turkeys, and came across some sort of  foundation made with two six foot sections of heavy steel I-beams plus lots of rocks. There were a few sections of 4"" steel pipe headed off into the brush but I couldn't follow it very far. My guess is at some point there was a really big pump down there by the creek. It's all limestone in there, so it would not be related to gold mining. I don't know what they were pumping water for, unless it was going several miles to the CCC camp up on the plateau above the canyon.

I attempted to go for a swim as the daytime temps were in the 90s. Nope. Cold water was COLD. Got elbow deep, decided I didn't need to prove anything to anyone when I'm out by myself, and then departed the water in a hurry.

The fifth day I hiked up a side canyon and found a shallow cave under a ledge. It was maybe 6 feet tall at the entrance and pinched off about ten feet back. There was soot on the roof and charcoal mixed in the with the dirt on the ground, so I expect it was used as a shelter going back to prehistoric times. It as not really big enough for anyone to live in, though, and it was in a shady bend in the side canyon that would be icy cold in winter. However, for a summer hunting camp? I'm sure they took full advantage of it. I hung out there for half an hour eating a snack and enjoying the cool breeze coming from the cracks in the rocks.

The whole time I was hiking that day I was thinking, ""This is the perfect place to find a snake when it warms up."" And then it warmed up and I was like, ""Okay, now it's perfect conditions, perfect snake weather. BE CAREFUL."" And I was poking likely looking bushes with my hiking poles as I walked, and avoiding areas of tall lovegrass, and going around logs rather than stepping over them ...

... and I still damn near stepped on a very angry little rattlesnake, even though I was actively watching as I walked. He blended right in.

After detouring around the snake (poking him with my hiking stick failed to get him to move out of the way, he bit my stick) I headed back to camp on very high alert. That was snake #4.

I decided after seeing four rattlesnakes, and nearly stepping on one, it was time to bail on the trip. I was in no mood to keep exploring after the last close call. I've been going to this cabin since the 1980s and had seen zero rattlers up to this point.

The snakes will settle down after a week or two -- it was the first really warm weather of the year and they were coming out of hibernation and looking for a meal. In the meantime, however, it was just plain time to nope. I decided I'd leave the next morning.

The last afternoon I made crawdad tails in ramen -- I caught two dozen large crawdads with a piece of beef stick on a string, in under half an hour.

The last night, around 9 PM, I was awakened by the sound of an elk grunting and a bear bellowing, about a quarter mile away up the canyon. I have to say that I have never heard anything like that before, and I've backpacked and lived in remote areas for a few decades ... I've only ever heard elk grunt during the rut when they're fighting with each other. It was pretty alarming for awhile, but then all was silent.

In the predawn hours, the coyotes started up.

At dawn, the crows started cawing like they do when they've found carrion.

Hmm. I assume the bear got himself an elk.

I decided discretion was the better part of valor, and I cut a wide berth around the area by bushwhacking up the (fortunately not steep) hills. I gave it several hundred yards of room. I really didn't want to confront a bear on a yummy kill .. the local bears will usually run from people, but why take chances? I also made LOTS of noise as I traveled.

I hiked out without seeing any more snakes, and made an uneventful exit to my car.

Various observations and things I learned:

\-- I had a down sleeping bag with me, one of the ones with no down on the underside. In theory this saves weight, but I've decided I dislike this concept. The first two nights were cold (30s) and every time I moved I had to readjust the sleeping bag to cover me, because the lack of insulation on the bottom let in the cold. Lots of cold air leaks and it kept waking me up. The last three nights were in the 50s and 60s and the bag was too warm, but better a bag that's too warm than not warm enough.

\-- The plastic piezo button on my stove caught fire when I was boiling up the crawdads. I had an extra large pot, had piled rocks around it on three sides to protect it from the wind, and apparently there was too much heat for the plastic. It was a cheap stove and not a huge deal from a ""can I still use this"" standpoint. I just needed to light it with a match after that. However, I was glad I'd cleared a several foot area clean of pine needles, with the stove in the middle, because the spring inside the piezo launched the burning plastic a couple of feet from the stove. (Sproing!) It easily could have started a fire if I wasn't paying attention and/or hadn't cleared the area.

\-- Meat bees (yellow jackets) like crawdad tails more than anything else in the world. I knew this. I've known this a long time. Each time I cook crawdads I tell myself not to cook the crawdads in camp. It would be smarter to do it down by the creek. Each time, I go, ""How bad can it be?"" And then I cook crawdads in camp and I vow never to do that again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

\-- I had skipped taking a footprint for my tent, and used my poncho for a footprint, since it wasn't likely to rain. This meant I had nothing to sit on in camp other than rocks or the ground -- usually I unroll the poncho and use it as a picnic blanket. I have a habit of laying on my back and reading books in the shade in the heat of the afternoon. I got a lot dirtier without the poncho to lay on, and was generally unhappy sitting in the dirt. (I expect to get dirty when backpacking, but this was a bit excessive.) Next time I am taking the footprint and/or an extra poncho, it's worth the extra weight.

I'm going out this weekend to the same area for a quick overnight -- hopefully the snakes have found themselves meals and have quit wandering around where I might step on them.

I am experimenting on this next trip with just taking some Old Trapper beef sticks, dried fruit, granola bars, and candy rather than full meals. I find making a meal a nuisance. It also saves a lot of weight if I don't have to haul along a stove, fuel, and a mess kit.",survival

Clothing Cold/Warm Discussion,3,gzbos0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gzbos0/clothing_coldwarm_discussion/,12,1591690136.0,"So, the old problem: clothing. What do you pack in your bag and what do you wear, specifically how do you manage large temperature differences? For example, if you are in the desert and being nude is still too hot, but at night you freeze your ass off, how do you manage this difference? And also How do you keep cool?

My ideas for packing warming clothes in a very small space (which is  always important) are space blankets, or wool clothes. of course there are problems with that, concerning durability or rain/water. You can of course add rain cover or durable special fabrics, but there may not be any room.

But the bigger problem, which i do not have ANY ideas to solve (in a survival scenario where recources are valuable as hell) is how to keep relatively cool, while carrying all you gear, your clothes for the cold and also while protecting yourself from the sun. Of course, sunscreen may be an option, but not always due to an allergy, suplly chain failure etc. or you might not have it with you in that particular scenario, so I will just assume that one uses long cloths to keep the sun away from the skin.

Almost Died On Sunday...,1068,gvn0b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gvn0b3/almost_died_on_sunday/,117,1591187360.0,"I have this high quality, 12 foot inflatable fishing boat. After investing in a medium sized motor, the stars aligned right, and I was able to go fishing on Sunday.

I decided to troll (drag a lure behind the boat) about 1-1.5 miles out, and then switch to bait fishing. I trolled about a mile offshore, got one of my poles set up and in the water, but on the calmest of days and in the actual middle of the ocean, I drifted into a reef. 

I turned my throttle to the fastest reverse setting, and in doing so, the current shifted me parallel just in time for a GOD DAMN rogue wave to hit me from the side, and flip my boat. Im fairly certain either the plywood flooring or the hinged top to my plywood storage box, hit me on the head and discombobulated me for like 10-15 second as I watched literally everything sink to the ocean floor.

I finally came to, and the first thing I decided was I needed to get my ""Oh Shit"" bag, I packed just in case something happened. So I swam to my storage box that was like 5 feet away from me, and grabbed my bag. I resurfaced, opened my bag, and pulled out my goggles and swim fins. I was underwater trying to get my fins on, but at the same time I was trying to keep the contents of my bag inside while I was getting smashed on on this reef.

I finally got everything on and figured that swimming to my boat, that was about 20 feet from me, was my best strategy to regain my bearing. When I was around 5-10 feet from the boat, I saw my storage box got tangled in my docking rope and was dragging behind the boat. I opened the lid to the box to see if anything was still inside, and the first thing I grabbed was the knife. Then I decided to grab my tackle box and some rope just in case. I swam to the boat with all that stuff just to realize that the 80 lb boat, was flipped upside down. Im not sure how, but on the first try I flipped the boat over, with ONE HAND!

I threw everything in the boat, and launched myself inside. After I laid there for a second to catch my breath, I sat up and didn't see any deep cuts or bleeds. I looked around to see how far I was from shore and to see if I could see any of my stuff. I saw my cooler, my life jacket, and a small red container, all spread out in different directions around 10ft feet from the boat. My paddles and motor were gone, and I knew I needed my life jacket and the water / food from the cooler. Unfortunately, the current was taking the life jacket in a different direction than me, but luckily, the cooler was about to float by me. As if nothing else could go wrong, the cooler was about 6 inches out of my reach.

I thought about what to do next and what my best chance of survival was. It was a toss up between packing what I could in my dry bag and swimming to the closest shore that was at least a mile away, or stay in the boat and either hope someone passes by me or hope the current took me towards land instead of out to sea. I decided that I had my fins and goggles, but also had confidence in my swimming ability (since I used to be a swimmer and remember the form for sidestroke, freestyle, backstroke, and breast stroke), so I thought it the best option would be to swim back. 

The physical part of swimming in the ocean wasn't as bad as the mental aspect. Once I cleared the reef, I notice the ocean floor rapidly dropping and I have never felt so unnerved in my entire life. What didn't help were the reoccurring cramps I kept getting in my left calf and hamstring. I couldn't stop my imagination from running a bit wild. I knew statistically that shark attack wasn't likely, but with the way I was cramping I couldn't stop myself from thinking I was like an endangered fish. I felt extreme sadness and regret because I knew if I died I wouldn't have left much to my son and wife.

I was about 150 yards from the shore when I saw a small boat about to pass by. I flagged them down, and they headed towards me, and helped me into the boat. The guy and his kids said they want to help me get my stuff back, so we found my boat, my cooler, and my life jacket. I lost my phone, GoPro, fishing poles, motor, and battery. I feel super shook right now. At some point I realized that I could have died and nobody would ever truly know what happened to me.",survival

New York States or New Jersey. 

I can‚Äôt realistically carry ten days worth of water.

It will be my first time back packing, and I‚Äôm not sure which option is best. TLDR at the end.

weighing the following options: 1) boiling water each day, for daily use... 2) using a sawyer mini to filter out bacteria and UV to kill viruses.... or 3) a sawyer purifier to remove bacteria, viruses, and even chemicals pollutants.

1) Boiling water seems most foolproof, cheapest option, and effective for all pathogens. But it does nothing for non-organic contaminants like lead, etc. if oil go this route, how do I determine which water sources aren‚Äôt going to poison me with industrial runoff or some shit?

2) seems affordable, and user friendly. But doesn‚Äôt remove viruses. If I‚Äôm gathering water where other people have been ill probably guzzle noroviruses and get diarrhea in the wilderness. No thanks. But... how do I purify with UV? Just leave a clear bottle out in the sun while I hike? I mean, I can‚Äôt see UV so I can‚Äôt guess what it can penetrate- plastics, glass... what kind of bottle is conducive to UV sterilization?

3) most expensive option, but it seems almost entirely worth free. But I don‚Äôt want to spend money on a thing I can only use a couple hundred times or whatever and then have to replace.

4) I deliberately left the chemical tablets option off the list. I‚Äôm going to bring a few with me in case whatever other option I use as a first choice fails. But I hate the taste of chemically treated tap water so I don‚Äôt think I want to rely on that unless I really must.

5) I didn‚Äôt think of this until just now, but sunlight penetrates open water, if i only gather water from the top centimeter of a lake or something, would it be partially UV zapped? (I know currents constantly stir that shit up, just wondering if it makes any difference) 

6) I‚Äôve also thought about setting up a tarp trap for rain waters and what not, to refill a jug without needing to purify. But then I‚Äôm really at the mercy of the elements and i might try that for fun, but It wouldn‚Äôt be reliable as a plan A.

Anyone ever heard a story of a survivalist finding fire by visiting the site of a lightning strike?,3,gpsrjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gpsrjh/anyone_ever_heard_a_story_of_a_survivalist/,2,1590367101.0,"So there's this mystery:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAgMVvGB0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAgMVvGB0w)

Why do humans smell petrichor in air 200,000x better than sharks smell blood in water? Why do we smell ozone so incredibly well also? We have a lot of theories, but not much in the way of evidence.

The basic mystery is that it should take phenomenal evolutionary pressure to produce such a keen sense of smell for these scents. Humans have smaller olfactory centers in the brain and a poor sense of smell in general than most animals, yet we have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell for these petrichor and ozone. Other animals need rain too, but apparently don't have the ability to smell it nearly as well as we humans do.

There's some missing explanation. There's something that happened in human evolutionary history that made people that could smell petrichor and ozone far, FAR more likely to survive than people that couldn't. People that couldn't smell these scents tended to die and not pass on their genes. People that had a keener sense for these scents were far more likely to survive.

Whatever was happening, it must have continued to happen for evolutionary timescales. Hundreds of thousands to millions of years. For untold generations, humanity became more and more sensitive to these scents to have developed such acute senses for them.

There are a lot of theories for why this is, some say we have many desert adaptations like perspiration and a lack of body hair so we developed these senses to find water in hot arid environments. If that's the case why don't other animals have the same adaptations?

I have a different theory, I think these are adaptations our ancestors used to find fire (I'm sure I'm not the only one to come up with this). I think that the need to procure fire is the only thing that could exert that much pressure on our ancestors. Only fire could have sharpened our senses to this extent. Fire means more calories from food, food preservation, safer food, safer water and protection from the cold at night. Its also a necessary component in the production of tools from glue to needles.

I'm guessing we are very strongly adapted to sense a storm coming, so we can gather materials necessary to procure fire from nearby lightning strikes. We can smell a storm coming to give us time to get ready. We can smell ozone in the air to help us pinpoint the locations of lightning strikes quickly. Our genus has existed for millions of years on this planet, and has used fire for about that long, but I'm guessing that learning to create fire is a relatively recent invention.

The uncontacted sentinelese tribe, the one that kills anyone that sets foot on their island. They don't have the ability to create fire. They apparently have to procure it after a lightning strike.

So my question for the survival experts on this reddit is, have any of you ever heard of stories in modern times where someone procured fire from a lightning strike? Do you know of any anecdotes or tales of a person or people in a survival situation that managed to find fire in this manner?

Does this theory pass a basic plausibility test? Is finding fire in storms something that we're capable of?  


EDIT: Oh and please don't try to investigate this yourself. Lightning is dangerous and it doesn't kill a lot of people but you're way more likely to get killed if you go chasing it during a storm. ",survival

For example, while hiking down the backside of Ben Nevis, I tore my MCL. As I only had another mile or two to hike. I fashioned a knee splint from duct tape gauze and a Sam splint. Creating essentially a Jones dressing with a posterior rigid structure. Luckily after hiking the next 2 miles I was able to call a taxi. Although all I required was crutches, I was told you cannot purchase crutches in the United Kingdom and therefore had to go to the emergency department or as they referred to it as A & E. 


        I also was extremely happy on a trip to Algonquin provincial Park for a 12 day canoe trip, when having cut open my hand on the gunnel of the canoe, I was happy to find several large Tegaderm in our first aid kit. As we were five days inn and it would take at least 48 hours to extricate, I was forced to attempt primary closure in the field. Utilizing both oral ethanol as well as topical, I was able to achieve both analgesia and a sterile field for closure. The applications of many overlapping Tegaderms was sufficient to create a water tight dressing that still allowed function of the hand despite frequent exposure to water. I realized that one of the most difficult issues with wound care in the wilderness is maintaining a dry dressing.

Since then I have tried to keep an ample supply of Tegaderm as well as plenty of duct tape and Sam splints when traveling in austere locations.

I can guarantee some gram weenie is going to come on and comment about the weight of some of this stuff. I'm well aware I'll be carrying a lot of weight. Please note that I'm doing up to nine days without resupply, and I am NOT doing a lot of miles. My pack would look very different if this was a different kind of trip. 

Total pack weight inclusive of water and all food \~40-50 pounds. Haven't actually weighed it. Feels like a bag of feed when I pick it up. LOL.

The plan is to backpack in about three miles up a creek in Arizona's Rim country, set up base camp for 2-3 days and hike and explore the area. Then I'll move a mile or two up the creek, and rinse, lather, repeat, until I'm either tired of sleeping on the ground and scratching mosquito bites, or I have to go back to work. I expect I'll be out there something between seven and nine days. I will be surprised if I see anyone else; I'm going to be way off the beaten track. 

Also, note that I am planning on supplementing my meals with crawdads. This is why there is an extra-large pot and two cans of fuel. 

There is a fire ban -- campfires are not allowed.

I would love to hear from anyone about mistakes I made or things I left out, although remember this is a post targeted at beginners so it's main aim is to give people a set of basic, easy to follow guidelines to minimize the chance of being injured or killed by a bear.

Now, here is my comment, repurposed as this post:

When you see a bear give them a big hug, they are famous for hugging!

Seriously though, wild camping is actually a very very safe hobby. Considering the amount of people that take to the wild every year it's not actually that big of a deal to camp in bear country. Black bears are by far the most common bears to encounter. Between 1997 and 2017 there were 25 fatal black bear attacks in North America https://www.wideopenspaces.com/list-fatal-black-bear-attacks-north-america-last-20-years/ and also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America To put that in context, in just Yellowstone National Park in only the year 2018 there were 4.1 million visitors. The best place to start for safety in bear country in the US is here: https://www.nps.gov/articles/bearattacks.htm The most comprehensive book is still *Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance* by Herrero https://www.amazon.com/Bear-Attacks-Their-Causes-Avoidance/dp/149302941X

Basically there are 3 rules.

1st give them their space.

2nd don't mess with their cubs.

Those are obvious.

The 3rd and most important one is food. The vast majority of adults who get hurt by black bears do so because the bear was seeking the person's food and the person got hurt in the process. Make 3 separate spots: one for camping/sleeping one for cooking one for food storage. Don't bring food into your campsite or cook in your campsite. If possible the cooking and food storage sites should be downwind of the campsite so that the bear doesn't wander through your camp seeking your food. This may not be possible in areas with variable winds. Hang up your food or use a bear canister. If you hang your food don't just lazily hang it over a tree branch. Use two pieces of cordage tied to the food bag and suspend the bag at least 15' above the ground and 10' from either tree, by tying a rock to each piece of cordage and tossing it over a branch and then hoisting the bag up. Hang all smelly stuff, not just food: toothpaste sunscreen etc.

Here's a pic of what I mean from a duckduckgo search https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hang+bear+bag&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outsidebozeman.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Flarge%2Fpublic%2FBearBag.jpg%3Fitok%3D_xfgGO_O

There's other ways of doing it but that's the best one. The PCT method is 2nd best. Hang your bear bag in an area that is surrounded by open spaces so you can see whether or not the food is still hanging that way you don't walk up on them while they are munching on your GORP. Even with all the tricks I gave bears still mights get your food because they are real smart. Bear canisters or certain models of UrSak are probably the best overall but are expensive and bulky and don't hold much. You could always just store your food in your car.

If you encounter a black bear on the trail and it doesn't run away (or more likely meander away grumbling to itself) first option is to make yourself big and obvious, wave your arms, yell, etc. ***DO NOT RUN AWAY OR TURN YOUR BACK***. If you encounter a grizzly bear yelling and waving may provoke a defensive attack; look around to try to spot any cubs (you want to move away from the cubs not towards them and when startled the cubs may freeze, being furry and brown they are not that obvious) then back away slowly while keeping the bear in sight. Do not look the bear in the eyes. If the bear charges just throw it your backpack so it can have your food. Seriously. You can buy more Clif Bars. It's not worth getting injured or killed. If the bear is charging and throwing your backpack doesn't work then stand your ground. Use your bear spray or firearm if you have it ready. ***DO NOT RUN FROM A CHARGING BEAR***. Most charges are bluffs, running from a bluff may change the bluff attack into a real one. After the bear bluff charges return to backing away while keeping the hear in sight. Refer to my later section for differences between blacks and grizzlies regarding actual attacks.

Guns and bear spray are good options for defense if you are attacked. Of the two bear spray is objectively superior even among seasoned firearms users. For most people carrying a gun in the woods is more dangerous than any bear. However if you are experienced in handling and utilizing firearms they can be good options. If you aren't I would recommend against it. Neither are necessary if all you've got is black bears but they still might be wise depending on the bear activity in your particular area. In grizzly country you should carry bear spray even if you carry a firearm: either bear spray alone or bear spray + gun. When carrying bear spray do not carry it in your backpack. Carry it in a holster that you can access with one hand without looking at it. Practice drawing the bear spray from it's holster and presenting it several times before each trip so you can discover any problems, for example if it gets caught in your shirt or if it gets covered by your backpack's waist belt you need to address that. Practice while wearing your full kit and the clothes you hike in.

In black bear country .357 mag is the preferred choice among most. In grizzly country  it's classically been .44 mag but the current trend is toward 10mm. Most bear attacks that have been stopped by firearms have been stopped by 9mm using self defense rounds, simply because 9mm is the most common pistol caliber people carry for self defense. There are several recorded instances of grizzly bears being killed with .22lr.

If you are attacked by a black bear it's likely predatory so fight back with everything you have. Even if it's only your fists. If you are attacked by grizzly bears it's likely defensive so play dead by assuming the fetal position and covering your neck and head with your arms and hands as best you can.

I really don't like bear bells. There is no evidence they work and they scare off all the other wildlife and ruin it for other hikers. Major outdoor educators such as NOLS and Outward Bound have done away with bear bells in their classes even in grizzly country. The better option is to educate yourself about bears, and move deliberately and be observant. Don't let yourself get lulled into just mindlessly plodding down the trail. Every once and awhile stop and observe your surroundings. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Remember, it's better to heed that ""not right"" feeling and find out the feeling was wrong than to ignore that ""not right"" feeling and find out it was right.

As for snooping around your campsite? Yeah they're gonna do that regardless they are real curious. If you are out long enough a bear WILL come into your camp probably at night and you won't know it. If you don't have anything that interests them they'll nose around a bit then leave. A fun exercise is to clear all the debris from around your shelter, dig up the dirt a bit so it's nice and fluffy, then smooth it out so the dirt is still soft but very even. Then when you wake up you can see the tracks of all the critters that came to say hi. There will be many tracks, mostly rodents, and eventually, yes, bears.

And please remember that in wild nature, energy is precious so by and large the animals are not out to get you because in most places hunting humans is more trouble than it's worth so animals don't do it. Of course you should take precautions -that's why I'm writing this- but don't let caution become paranoia because that can ruin your experience.

Finally, the best piece of advice is that if you see a bear in the wild (and are not attacked) consider yourself lucky. Bears are really really cool animals and vital parts of the ecosystem.",survival

1. Why doesn't the cougar back off after a minute or two? It seems not worth it food-to-energy wise, and takes 3x as long.

2) Is there anything he could have done to scare it off faster? Would throwing rocks, stopping in his tracks and stomping a foot, or yelling louder done anything, or just aggravated it?

I was attacked by a raccoon,24,j2eow0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/j2eow0/i_was_attacked_by_a_raccoon/,38,1601466023.0,"This might seem dramatic compared to other survival situations but I can‚Äôt get help anywhere. I was attacked by a raccoon 

This sounds ridiculous I know but help me out here haha 

So my apartment complex has been overrun with raccoons for a long time now. It‚Äôs a pretty nice complex and I pay a lot for rent. They used to put a ladder in the dumpster everyday for raccoons to crawl out of because they would accidentally pick up like 10 raccoons in the garbage truck. It‚Äôs right next to a park and creek so it‚Äôs a good spot for them to live and snag some food. They aren‚Äôt really scared of people which is fine because they usually keep to themselves. I have never had a problem with them. They grab their trash and go. 

There is a little hole in the chain link fence that leads to the park right down the side walk of my apartment. Last night I was taking my two dogs out (big dogs-border collie/Aussie) and some ran ahead of us from the parking lot and through the hole. 
One of my dogs barked so I paused and once the raccoons were through the hole I kept walking. One of the raccoons ran back through the hole after he was already a bit away and literally charged us. One of my dogs was snapping and barking so aggressively but the raccoon was not even a little bit phased. I started backing up to give it space and get my dogs away but it would not stop coming. It was hissing and making a really loud noise. My dogs were freaking out and I started retreating as fast as I could while getting my dogs under control and keeping an eye on it. 

My dogs are up to date on rabies but I didn‚Äôt want to take chances. I started running and I was screaming a bit. It wasn‚Äôt the raccoon itself but they carry very deadly diseases. It chased me a really long ways. People came out to their balcony because of the commotion and were yelling. The raccoon was sticking to the fence which is covered in a thick bushy vine and would randomly jump out and try to bite. It chased me all the way to the base of my stairs until I was up the first flight (it was a really long distance). 

When I got to the top where the staircase is open the people on the balconies were talking to me and my friend who had watched the whole thing go down from my balcony. She said that everyone thought it was a mountain lion because it was hissing so loud and was banging through the vine against the fence so it seemed bigger than it was. 
I felt so silly but everyone said it was really terrifying to watch. 

I thought it had to be diseased because it chased me such a far distance and so aggressively. It was not trapped in a corner and it wasn‚Äôt defensive it was literally on the offense. 

I called my apartment complex the next morning because I didn‚Äôt want it to happen to anyone else and they seemed to take me seriously and told me they would look into the fence. They asked me to call animal control and have AC call them. 
So I did but AC said they can‚Äôt do anything until it bites someone. They said they weren‚Äôt going to go around banging bushes to find it and testing them for rabies was a really long process. He said raccoons in the area just aren‚Äôt scared of people and I probably got near it‚Äôs territory (it‚Äôs the sidewalk of my apartment so the raccoons shouldn‚Äôt have territory there??) 

I called the apartment complex back and told them what AC said and I asked them if they wanted me to send them a picture of the hole because it‚Äôs hard to find or if I could show it to them in person. 
She got really condescending and started calling me ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù (I am a 25yr old woman so that was offensive to be talked to as a child and not get the respect of a resident) she said she would go find the hole later but they would have to find a way to secure a chain link fence and the raccoons could climb over it anyways. I said that I understood that but maybe getting rid of the easy access would discourage them from being directly in that area. 

I now hate the raccoons in the area which is fair and I don‚Äôt want someone to get bit before they take action (what if a child got bit?). Either way no one is going to do anything at this point. 

I still have to take my dogs out at night. I would never suggest a gun and I‚Äôm scared if I used pepper spray it would just blow in me or my dog‚Äôs faces and then we wouldn‚Äôt be able  to see to get away from the raccoon. 

They are small and I know my dogs could easily fight it and I could too probably but I would get scratched and bit if I tried to kick it or something. I‚Äôm not trying to get me or my dogs bit because they are such high carriers of disease. 

it‚Äôs so silly to be scared of such a small cute animal but the potential for deadly diseases is serious when they are attacking. 
They are not scare of noises or stomping or movement. 

Does anyone have any advice on a weapon to use in defense against a raccoon when I take my dogs out at night? üòÇ",survival

I found this a couple of months ago, and it opened my eyes. I'm an owner of a Fallkniven A1 and S1 knives. Bought mostly with the idea that a strong reliable knife is the way to gon, but if you understand your tools and know a handful of skills even the crappiest of knives can get you a long way. Since then I've been using a Swiss Army Knife (Alox Farmer X) more and more as a way of practice my skills and I must say, it changed my philosophy thoroughly when it comes to wood processing tools.

Now I'm not saying you should all replace your fixed blade knife in your kit with a SAK. But if you consider buying/selecting a knife for your kit, maybe consider a smaller option. When it comes to a survival kit, weight is always a big concern. Besides that, smaller blades are better suited for finer task and these finer tasks can also be very important in a survival situation. 

Most of all, practice with different tools for the job. Know what to do when you don't have the ideal tool at hand, learn how to split wood without batoning on your blade or without an axe, and learn how to properly use folding knives where you're at. 

It's a good ideology in general when it comes to honing outdoor skills, not just knives.

I only own 2 Gerbers (Gator 1and Warrant) and this would be my first 'expensive' knive. I came across ESEE and the model 4 seems to fulfill my expectations in terms of blade size and durability, however there are still some issues I need someones opinion on:

\- Handle size. Apparently the handle is too small? I don't have particularly large hands for a man, I'd say about average (glove size about 10) but still...

\- Sheath. From what I can see the sheath does not provide a locking mechanism for the knive to not fall out unless it is some sort of clipping mechanism inside the sheath? Does anyone have any experience here?

\- Steel. Most of their models are using the 1095 which apparently makes them extremely durable but you will have to care for it more (grease the blade to prevent corrosion). They do have a 440C version of the ESEE but they state in their warranty explanation that this one will not be as durable. I am leaning towards the 1095 but in almost every forum I visited people recommend not getting a 1095 blade in favour of a 440C one. So yeah, any thoughts on that?

So yeah... Any help is appreciated!

Review of Multiple Fire Sources,13,ix2fpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ix2fpz/review_of_multiple_fire_sources/,6,1600730409.0,"Hello reddit, the objective of buying multiple fire starting tools is to prevent the risk of being unable to start a fire due to damage or depleted resources.

I bought a variety of fire starting products on 9/20/2020, windy, with a temperature range of 43 F to 63 F, depending on the time of day. All product links meet Grade A or Grade B of the FakeSpot Rating System, and hold 4.5 to 5 stars.

Classic Bic Lighter ($10.49) Bic lighters will almost always work, but if it is cold, you will have to warm it up with your hands. Classic Bic Lighters hold an hour worth of fuel. If you do the math, 60 Minutes X 60 Seconds, you get 3600 seconds. If you get a fire in a maximum of 10 seconds for all fire attempts, that is 360 fires per Classic Bic Lighter, or 7.89 Years (8 lighters X 360 days = 2880 days, 2880 days / 365 days = 7.89 years)

Pros:

Reliable fire source due to the flame

Fast fire starting due to the flame

The flint can be used after empty fuel

Cons:

Short Usage Period for each bic lighter

Possible leakage of fluid over time

Possible cracking during direct impact

Possible Explosions during high heat

Not Waterproof

Not Water Resistant

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Ferro Rod 1.5 x 6 inches ($14.99) This is the only product I have not bought, but due to its popularity, I did my research on the product to find the best brand and product.

To be speak safely, one ferro rod will provide 10,000 sparks. If it takes a maximum of 10 strikes to start a fire, you will have 1,000 fires, or 2,000 fires if 5 strikes is attempted. This is 1,000 to 2,000 fires per rod. 1,000 fires / 365 = 2.75 Years per rod or 2,000 fires / 365 = 5.5 Years per rod. Since there is two rods in the link listed below, that is 5.5 years if each rod provides 2.75 years (1,000 fires per rod), or 11 years if each rod provides 5.5 years (2,000 fires per rod).

Pros:

Reliable due to amount and temperature of sparks

Impact Resistant due to the metal strength

Waterproof since it is only a metal

Water resistant since it is only a metal

Cons:

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Pocket Size Fresnal Lens ($4.75) Surprisingly, the pocket size fresnal lens started a fire with a piece of charcloth in under 10 seconds, even during the cold and windy day. Fresnal Lens should last forever if scratches are prevented, since plastic decays after a several thousand years. Within the link listed below, each fresnal lens comes in individual sleeves, which are collectively within a larger thick clear pouch. Therefore, the only way to deeply scratch these lens is by taking the fresnal lens out of the individual sleeves.

Pros:

Can be used to alert passing air vehicles with the focal light

Can be used to magnifying words for reading

Lasts forever if properly used

Reliable if it is sunny

Somewhat impact resistant

Water resistant

Waterproof

Cons:

Not reliable if it is cloudy

Can scratch easily making it unusable

Fire Piston ($24.75) This product is great, and will ignite charcloth using only air! The inside is metal within both pieces, so even if the wood decays during a second lifetime, it will still work! All you have to do is remove the o-ring during non-usage, and apply lubrication during each usage to extend the o-ring life to 5 years each. I bought a bag of the correct sized o-rings, containing 100 pieces for about 6-7 dollars on amazon. So in other words, with proper care from rusting, the product could last for 500 years! Remember to use spit to lubricate!

Pros: Lasts almost forever due to wood protection

Only requires air and charcloth to start a fire

Waterproof

Water resistant

Impact Resistant

Cons:

Possible rusting if unproperly used

Steel Striker for Flint with Bow-Drill Hole ($27.82) This is a very hard tool, and I do not recommend it for beginners. I was unable to start a fire with a rock which gave sparks. This was not possible with flammable substance or charcloth. I have not used the bowdrill, due to the time requirements of using a bow-drill. However, this striker will last a very long time since steel does not erode very easily.

Pros: Can find flint anywhere to be used for the striker

Common stick can be used for the bow-drill hole

Lasts as long as the steel

doesnt erode

Impact resistant

Cons:

Time Consuming

Blisters on your hands

Fire is not likely guaranteed

It would take me over an hour to do this with a saw due to the exhaustive effort I put on those limited muscles.

"Inexpensive, shelf-stable lip balm formula",134,ivixhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ivixhj/inexpensive_shelfstable_lip_balm_formula/,38,1600507178.0,"With colder weather approaching, I have finally got around to a project that I have been meaning to do for years.

There are a lot of home-made lip balm formulas online, but they weren't really what I was looking for.

While they are no doubt just as effective as the store bought stuff, the disadvantage is that they have a limited shelf life.

I wanted to come up with a lip balm base that can be made in bulk and stored pretty much indefinitely.

I began by using formulas available online but substituting perishable ingredients (such as coconut oil) with non-perishable ones.

After some experimentation, I have finally come up with something that I believe is about equal to store bought lip balm sticks, and won't go rancid like the homemade stuff.

As a bonus, the ingredients are simple, cheap, and available pretty much anywhere. Making the stuff is really simple too.

This makes a plain white lip balm base that has no taste or odor. Colors and flavors can be added, but this may decrease the shelf life.

While I was not deliberately aiming for a vegan formulation, it just so happens that none of the ingredients are animal in origin.

Ingredients:

Paraffin wax (sold in supermarkets as canning wax)

Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, though the generic ones are fine)

Mineral oil USP (in the laxative section of the pharmacy)

The formula is 1 part wax, 2 parts petroleum jelly, 3 parts mineral oil measured by weight.

Put the ingredients in a pan and **slowly** warm it on a low heat until it *just* melts. This is the trickiest part. Be careful not to overheat the mixture.

When it is all melted, stir well and pour into a suitable container such as a canning jar for storage.

This is your bulk supply. When you want to use some,  scoop a portion out with a spoon and re-melt it.

The consistency is perfect for filling empty lip balm tubes or small cosmetic pots, which can be bought on Amazon or from most craft stores.

If you want to make a more luxurious version, substitute beeswax instead of paraffin wax.",survival

Emergency Flint & Steel Fire when you have no flint and no steel.,53,iuflr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iuflr8/emergency_flint_steel_fire_when_you_have_no_flint/,16,1600361032.0,"If you don't have a purpose-built steel striker, many other things will work.  Do you have something else that is carbon steel?  Or can you find an old tool in a cellar hole or dump?  Can you salvage a part from a junk car or atv wreck?  Keep an eye out as you walk along the trail for a piece of metal.  But it has to be carbon steel-  not stainless steel, and not soft steel like the typical nail, sheet metal, angle iron, etc.

Is your knife carbon steel?  If not, then what about your ax?  If you're not sure then hit it with a hard rock.

What rocks are available in the area?  Flint or chert is good, if you can find it.  Quartz will also work, along with many other rocks.  Basalt can work if you knap a sharp edge on it.  Granite can work because it has quartz in it.  If you're not a geologist, don't worry.  You don't have to be an expert at identifying rocks.  You just have to locate a hard rock, not one one that is soft or crumbles easily.  Then hit it with your piece of steel.  If you see sparks, you are good to go.  Some steels are better than others for this purpose as are some rocks.  So with a good kit you could be getting gobs of fat sparks.  If your improvised kit is only throwing a few, wimpy sparks, that's ok.  It will likely take a little longer for a spark to hit your tinder and catch, but you can make it happen.  Just keep trying.

What kind of metal objects might work?  We already mentioned axes and knives.  And it's not just fixed blade knives.  Many antique and vintage pocket knives are carbon steel and throw wonderful sparks.  Learn how to identify the satisfying grey of old carbon tool steel.  If you are carrying an ax, you likely have a file to sharpen it.  Most files make great steel strikers.  Chisels often work well.  Hammers can throw sparks.  You should know that many tools are deferentially heat treated.  That means one area is harder than another part of the tool.  The hammer head's striking surface might throw sparks, but not the top.  The file's side might spark, but not the handle.  Pliers and wire cutters can throw sparks and also saw blades and many other tools.  Car parts, motorcycle parts, and other machine components are something to check.  Not everything will work, but you only have to find one thing that does.  Understand that you should clean grease and remove paint and rust from the striking area.  The cleaner it is, the better it will work.

It helps to practice with found rocks in your area, and also with various metal objects.  If you are poor, or unable to source a professionally-made steel striker in your area, you can make your own flint & steel kit.  Simply cut up, or break down the metal object to the size you want.  Find a rock, and knap a sharp edge.  Find some sort of metal tin for charring cloth, punk wood, fungus, and other things.  You're good to go.

Animal attack cheat sheet (for animals found in the PNW),563,itgzez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itgzez/animal_attack_cheat_sheet_for_animals_found_in/,155,1600230526.0,"I frequently go camping, hiking, or otherwise exploring. I‚Äôm insanely anxious and I always overthink my safety, so I‚Äôm sharing with you guys the list of techniques I‚Äôve made to avoid and/or survive attacks by some wild animals that we have here in the PNW.


COUGARS/MOUNTAIN LIONS-

If approached- Do NOT run. Do not turn your back to them, they are ambush predators. Make yourself look bigger to appear threatening. Maintain constant eye contact as you yell, make loud noises, and wave your arms about. Try to scare them off. Again, do NOT run as they will most likely attack.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. Try to remain on your feet and protect your head and neck. Fight back by any means possible. This means punching, kicking, any weapons you may have or nearby objects that can be used as a weapon.


BLACK BEARS-

If you see a black bear, respect its space. They will usually avoid you in turn as they are fairly timid. If you must pass them, give them a wide berth. They would rather flee than fight.

If approached- If you have children in your party, keep them close. Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand and face the bear directly. Speak calmly to identify yourself as something that is not a prey animal. If that does not work, make yourself look larger, and make loud noises to scare the bear away. Avoid direct eye contact.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. If you can escape to a safe location like a car or house, do it, but if not, then fight back. Black bears will not leave you alone if you play dead. Concentrate kicks and blows to the bear‚Äôs face and snout.


GRIZZLY BEARS-

If you see cubs, slowly back away. They are cute and may actually be intrigued by you, but do not interact since mama bear is probably close by and will certainly kick your ass. 

If approached- Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand tall and make yourself look large. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it is most likely just curiosity. Slowly back away with your bear spray in your hand. Ideal spraying distance is 40-50 feet.

If attacked- Lay down and do NOT fight back. This will intensify the attack as the bear is usually trying to neutralize you as a threat. Assume a fetal position, protecting your stomach with your knees, and lace your fingers behind your neck to protect it. If the bear stops attacking, stay ‚Äúdead‚Äù for at least 15-20 minutes because it will linger to see if you‚Äôre dead or just injured. If the bear is gone, back away slowly rather than running just in case they are watching from a distance. If the attack persists after you‚Äôve played dead, fight back only as a last resort, and aim for the bear‚Äôs eyes and snout.


WOLVERINE-

Wolverines have a reputation for being scary, but they are more likely to just throw a tantrum in order to scare you since bluffing is their forte. They are also not large- similar to a medium sized dog.

You will rarely encounter these in the wild since they are shy and solitary creatures. As far as I know, there are no cases of wolverines attacking humans. Just go back the way you came, or if you continue, give them space and keep an eye out. It‚Äôs unlikely that they‚Äôll hurt you.


PORCUPINE-

Porcupines are not often seen in the daytime as they are nocturnal and timid. They are short sighted and easily startled, so if you encounter a porcupine, walk a large distance around it if possible. They may swish their tail around which makes a strange noise, but unless you scare or threaten them, they are unlikely to quill you.

If quilled- remove them as quickly as possible so that the swelling doesn‚Äôt make it harder. Cut off the long end so that you can get a good grip on it and tug on it. If you can, do not twist or break it off. Do not use bare hands because this can injure your hand as well. If possible, wash the wounds well with soap and water and then apply antibiotic cream. Watch the wounds for redness, swelling, or itching. If you are quilled in the face or if the quills will not come out, see a doctor.

Encounter with a Mama (Black) Bear,160,itdxzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itdxzx/encounter_with_a_mama_black_bear/,59,1600221465.0,"Hello I was recently hiking on the Coast in the Pacific Northwest and had a close encounter with a Mama black bear and two cubs.


I was hiking and saw a few fellow hikers yelling and whistling at something in the distance. A moment later I saw the outline of a bear on the beach zig zagging back and forth from the water to the forest line. The hikers said the Mama bear and cubs came out behind them from the woods. We watched for a second before realizing the bears were still coming towards us.¬†


We began yelling, using the emergency whistles we had on us, banging our hiking poles loudly over head, and saying ""hey bear!"" in a loud voice. Nothing seemed to stop her.


Figuring if we gave her ample space she would pass, or retreat into the woods. Unfortunately we backed (slowly) towards the water to let her pass (she had about 75 yards of beach to safely pass) instead she stopped, and made a 90 degree turn straight at us.


Once we realized she was walking right at us and wasn't stopping, and the only way out was to go swimming or try to climb a sea stack and having forgotten my bear spray in the car, I pulled out my pistol and fired once into the air (towards the ocean) . To our surprise the cubs ran but mama just stopped and stared.¬† We then fired twice more and she ran. Once she took off I decided wading through the water would be the safest and fastest way out.¬†


Less than five minutes later she was back on the beach in the same spot where we had fired the shots.


I know bears like to bluff to get you to back down, however since we were stuck with our backs toward the ocean with nowhere to retreat, would she have attacked had she gotten closer?¬†


Also lesson learned I won't be forgetting my bearspray again.¬†All my life I've heard, ""bears are more scared of you then you are of them"", that really diddnt seem to be the case, she brazenly walked towards 5 of us being big, and loud which diddnt have any effect on her whatsoever.

I always carry some additional warm clothing and a rain jacket, no matter what the weather report says.

And other hikers told me I am an idiot. It's pounds of additional weight for nothing. And I did not give a shit. Better be prepared, just in case.

Last week my gf slipped on a tricky descent in the mountains. She broke her leg in 2 places and tore a ligament (she is actually in surgery right now and will get some screws into her leg to fix the bones). I set her down, put the warm clothes on her when she started shivering and went into shock. I gave her pain killers and the go-pills to get her up again. I cut down a small tree to make a walking aid and put a stick on her leg with the bandages to immobilize it. Then we spend an hour moving down the mountain, little by little, until we got to a clearing with cell phone reception and could call for help. She was evacuated by chopper.

So when people tell you that you are over-preparing and to not waste the weight, ignore them. Every piece of additional equipment I had on me, everything people had told me was useless, it all paid of that day.",survival

"Secrets to finding flint in areas where experts say there is no flint. It's a good survival skill to have- The ability to pick up a rock and make a tool, or use it to make fire. Flint and chert are highly prized for this. But what if you live in an area where ‚Äúeveryone says‚Äù there is none?",363,ihm6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ihm6yj/secrets_to_finding_flint_in_areas_where_experts/,31,1598567955.0,"One example is where I live-  New Hampshire, US.  Most of the sources say that there is no flint or chert to be found here.  The reason for that statement is that the sedimentary rock was scoured away by glaciers, and is now out in the ocean somewhere.  Almost all flint and chert is biological in origin, so it's found in sedimentary rock such as limestone.  There is no sedimentary bedrock here, so therefore no flint (or so they claim).  That statement is true, but only in a general sense.  You will not find it in the bedrock or exposed ledge.  You won't find large deposits of it.  But you can find it in the woods, and here are a few secrets -

Those same glaciers that scoured away our sedimentary bedrock also brought in rocks from far away.  Because of this one geologist wrote that you might find just about any kind of rock in New Hampshire.  The context was he was writing to the general public.  It wasn't a formal paper to fellow academics.  Still, his general observation was an amazing variety of rocks, so he wrote that you might find almost any kind of rock here.  And I would say this applies to a very large area, not only the small state of New Hampshire.  I believe that most of the North American continent was covered by glaciers at one time.  That means that flint or chert may have been brought there by glaciers from far away.

Where should you look for chert?  Look in stream and creek beds.  Ones with a fast current are better because it tends to keep the rocks clean from algae, moss, and other vegetation.  Also look alongside the trail and along the road.  Let's face it-  It's much easier to find rocks on the surface of the ground than dig for them.  Mining is a lot of work, obviously.  When you find a rock that you suspect to be chert, you may have to break it open in order to identify it.

Another place to look for chert is along old Indian trails and areas settled by them.  One way that rocks move is by being carried by humans.  The American Indians had an extensive trade network, and one commodity was chert.  Many roads and trails in the US were originally Indian trails.  Some of these can be found in old records.  But most (I believe) you would have to find by talking to people or knowing how to recognize them.  You can also learn to identify likely settlements.  This topic I plan to address later.

The last secret I want to go over today is finding lost or discarded gun flints.  Poor people used flintlocks in rural areas long after the invention of percussion firearms and even cartridge ammunition.  So you might find flint in and around old cellar holes, and also in hunting areas.  Certain vantage points have always been good for hunting with a firearm.  If you see a tree stand, spent casings, etc on a ridge if you look carefully you might find flint as well.

Before I sign off, I would like to thank Jay of Vision Quest Outdoors for his help.  I also thank him for challenging me to go out and find chert in the woods.  Check out his Youtube channel if you get a chance.

I hope this helps you.  I also want to give you a challenge.  I'm calling it Chert Quest 2020.  Go out and try to find chert in your area, especially if it is an area where people say it doesn't exist.

God bless!

The trap that I‚Äôve chosen is the paiute deadfall. This is the first trap that I‚Äôve constructed and so far I‚Äôm impressed with the simple design and the sensitive trigger mechanism. Its been mentioned a lot however, that deadfalls ruin or taint the meat because the internal organs could burst .curious if that is true or a concern in a survival situation. If so do snare traps have the advantage? In my experience the squirrels and rats that were killed from the trap tasted good and seemed perfectly Edible.

Knife is for sure required, but I have my folding knife. Is the belt knife necessary if I have a hatchet (for splitting wood)?

Can't get a decent machete here, but I have a banana knife that does the same job (thin curved blade on a 2 ft handle). Only job it does that the others don't do well is cutting brush or use as a weapon. It's beveled on only one side so it sucks for splitting

Saw for cutting trees and bamboo and crafting. Actually wouldn't consider NOT bringing both a fine toothed and coarse toothed blade.

Hatchet? Can baton with the belt knife (belt knife would work better for bamboo in fact), can cut trees with the saw. Only thing I can think of is splitting solid wood, and I don't imagine myself doing that much. 

Had a really thick local-style machete, but it sucks at everything. The point is curved like you'd use it to stab which makes it terrible for chopping, it's too thick so it won't cut brush, the balance sucks so it's not great for fighting either (I imagine). Only thing it does better than anything else is batoning (the balance sucks so bad that I wouldn't even want to try chopping by swinging the damn thing).

As mentioned, I am a professional photographer. I just got into ""survival style camping"" and will be going out over a weekend soon into the wilderness.

My survival backpack I built is extremely light, I was able to make a backup with EVERYTHING you can think of including an entire fishing set and grill for under 35 lbs. I put a lot of time and research into building a very lightweight set up. I live in a warm climate so I was able to get away without needing a lot of gear for warmth. Now the question is the camera. I shoot with a Nikon D750 normally. That plus the lens alone are extremely heavy, not to mention all of the other gear. I am wondering if there are other pro photographers out there who have found a camera that is lightweight with a lens such as the 24-70mm f2.8 range that is able to capture raw images for post-processing later. I am very hesitant to take my set up as it is too heavy and bulky. I was thinking about maybe the mirrorless Z series from Nikon, but with the lens on it, I am not sure if it gets much lighter.

Eldorado national forest trip report,6,hd2424,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hd2424/eldorado_national_forest_trip_report/,14,1592749765.0,"I took a trip with another friend of mine into eldorado national forest. We stayed from the 13th-20th of June. I brought in 15,100 calories of food in total. I brought a garmin inreach mini satellite messenger, bear bag, clothes, tarp, rain gear, sleep system, a knife, and a multitool and other miscellaneous items. I am a wilderness first and have been practicing survival skills for a long time. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the trip by day.

Day 1: Dropped off. My own carelessness and not checking google maps which I had downloaded a map of the area on was a mistake. If I did we‚Äôd have realized that the directions we had found to get to this area were not good. We wasted 45 minutes of walking before I checked out of suspicion that we weren‚Äôt even near the trailhead. We were about ten miles or so of walking on highways away from it. So I drop some pins marking a path to walk to the trailhead but it‚Äôs still some distance to cover given it‚Äôs already about 2 pm, so we walked as far as we could to get there. We stopped walking at about 4 by a big creek and set up camp. We were still many miles off from our destination. 2 important details to mention are that I collected some mullein (non native to the area and grows a lot by roads) on the walk in and also that my left boot got wet crossing the river to hang up the bear bag. 

Day 2: We had planned to get up early so we can rush to our destination. My left boot was wet so I was unable to walk with it on, because even in the summer the morning air and the water of that boot were super cold for my left foot. I opted to walk in three layers of socks until it warmed up and could put on the shoes bearably. Don‚Äôt let your shoes get wet, people. We eventually arrive and go to set up cam, trying several different locations trying to find a good spot. Eventually we find one that is somewhat close to the lake but is maybe 40 feet  above it with an easy route down. I assumed that the increase in elevation and relative dryness of that spot would mean few mosquitos and boy was I wrong. The mosquitos were very annoying and made me regret not bringing a mosquito net which would have weighed nothing. Also, when I went to fill my water bladder, I heard a rattling noise and after a second I realize that‚Äôs a rattler and back away from the noise. I saw him going under a log about 15 feet away from me after I had vigorously backed away. This was a mildly terrifying experience but it was reassuring he seemed to be on the defensive and that he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I ended up seeing a number of other snakes during this trip including a California striped racer, 2 sierra gartners and another snake I can‚Äôt remember the name of.

Days 3 and 4: Here‚Äôs where Id have to start looking into my notebook because around here the days start blurring together. I remember being very low on energy, until I had taken my first dump of the trip. i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of that or because I wasn‚Äôt eating enough but I digress. I taught my friend several different deadfall trap variations, including the paiute (really good with how high friction the granite there is), the figure 4, and the sam sea. We did not set any unattended or bait any and were just fucking with them for fun. Doing this and attempting to drop a coal on the bow drill (once again for fun because fires were not permitted) made me realize how bad the materials you have to work with can be. Nothing I tried would work for bow drill, aspen, sierra juniper, doug fir, I even tried pine because I wanted the coal so badly, and none of it worked. All of the wood would gloss up super quickly even if I knew it to be a good wood for friction fire. or it would pass the thumbnail test. Also at this point I realized I had fucked up in leaving my chapstick at home because my lips were giant black scabs at this point.

Day 5: Remeber that mullein I mentioned earlier? Well I did a hand drill on an incense cedar hearth board with it and it was amazing. Dropped 2 coals with this combo where bow drill had completely failed me. On the drive out I stopped the car to take home some more mullein (once again not a native plant) for practice at home. 

Day 6: On this day my friend and I use his John Muir Law‚Äôs guide to sierra nevada to identify all different kinds of organisms to make a species list. That was pretty fun and a good way to kill time because time at this point had started to drag a bit. I took a swim in the lake. My friend and I made a giant ass paiute deadfall for fun. That was pretty much it.

Day 7: at this point Im just really bored of messing with paiutes and my hands are fucked up from paiute deadfalls/granite/handdrill so there wasn‚Äôt a ton to do outside of just relax and try to observe nature and take it in. A technique I like to use called a silent sit or a sit spot which is essentially just sitting in a spot and trying to observe nature and eventually animals will come close to you and start coming out of hiding. I spent roughly 2 hours in one spot just admiring my last full day there. This was the worst night in terms of mosquitos. 

Day 8. Hiked out to our pick up spot. I packed up a few primitive skills materials, my favorite paiute, and some hearthboards I had made from incense cedar sticks from the ground. Our ride was a bit late so we hiked down the road towards it to get to a main road in hopes of getting service because the garmin inreach was all but dead. Luckily our ride appeared while we were hiking back. 

**TL;DR/takeaways**
Use your modern technology to your advantage. Vague instructions from the forest service and other parties can fuck you over. 

Bring chapstick. 

Bring some kind of way of dealing with bugs. 

Don‚Äôt let your boots get wet, or any piece of clothing for that matter. 

You will have a lot of down time and I‚Äôd imagine in a survival situation you‚Äôd be trying to save energy or make things that are  useful while hiding from the elements. 

I probably should have brought sunscreen.

Take advantage of resources as you pass them when it is ethical to do so. 

You won‚Äôt always have good materials so traps like the figure 4 which seem pretty dependent on good materials have a severe disadvantage to something you can make which mediocre materials like the paiute. 

Make sure you know what to do with venomous snakes. 

Anyway sorry for the shit writing I‚Äôm a bit tired and hope this info can help",survival

He stumbles and falls - gets separated from the guides - into one of the rainwater deposits, but can climb out without much problem, but he'll need to spend the night before he could get out.

Trip Report -- Backpacking in Arizona's Rim Country,6,h02sn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/h02sn4/trip_report_backpacking_in_arizonas_rim_country/,8,1591788190.0,"https://reddit.com/link/h02sn4/video/pewmd96l40451/player

I backpacked into a remote area of Arizona, planning ""about"" seven to nine days, starting the Memorial Day Weekend. As it turned out, the trip was six days, and it was an example of knowing when to nope out that I'll get into in a bit.

I'm being deliberately vague about the location of this canyon. It's remote enough, and challenging enough, that I almost never see people. I'd like to keep it that way. For remote places like this I figure the price of admission is finding it yourself.

It's north of Arizona's Mogollon Rim, at an elevation of about 6500 feet. There is perennial water (and lots of it), and an impressive amount of wildlife.

Note that I was purposely taking it very easy on this trip. I'd done something unpleasant to my back about three weeks before, and didn't want to aggravate the injury. Also, I was more interested in exploring the area than I was in putting in lots of miles. This region has a rich history dating back 5000 years (prehistoric Native Americans) and all the way to the modern day, with ranching starting in the 1800s and CCC work in the 1930s, so there's lots of stuff to find.

The first day, I hiked in about a mile and set up camp at an old campground. The campground is long abandoned -- it was built by the CCC and was gone to ruins in the 80s when I first saw it. It still has a picnic table, some foundations, and the remnants of road leading into it, but isn't on any maps and isn't used for camping except by the occasional backpacker.

However, it was a three day weekend, and right after I set up, a family with mom, dad, teenage daughter and daughter's boyfriend appeared -- first time in about five years (and about 20 trips, including other three day weekends) that I've run into anyone else in the area. They were fly fishing, catching crawdads for dinner, and having a good time while. However, I decided to move a bit farther up the canyon the next day. I wanted solitude and they said they were coming back daily to fish for a few more days.

The following morning, I hiked about another two miles up the canyon, and ran across my first rattlesnake in the middle of the trail, having a sunbath. I was alertly watching for snakes as the conditions were perfect, so I saw him first and shoo'd him off the trail with the end of a trekking pole.

I also saw the first of several small groups of turkeys. In the late morning I made camp on a sand bar (there was zero chance of flooding), and poked around a bit. The sandbar was not an ideal campsite, however, as the sand was fine silty crap that was getting in everything. Also, once the morning breezes died down there were black flies everywhere and -- when the wind shifted that evening -- there was a very strong scent of both skunk and carrion. It was too late in the day to move camp when things got stinky, so I sucked it up for the night.

As a side note, in most canyons you can plan on up-canyon winds during the day and down-canyon winds at night. The only time this isn't true is when a strong weather system is coming through.

The next day I found the source of the dead animal stink about a hundred yards up the canyon -- a large bull elk that had been reduced to bones, scraps, and a very bad lingering smell. I looked for the skull, but didn't find it.

I moved another mile and a half up the canyon that day. Saw another rattlesnake while hiking, plus several other non-poisonous snakes.

The third camp was on a bench overlooking a nice series of pools of water. It was high enough to catch a breeze (so fewer biting insects) and there was a nice carpet of pine needles under some of the biggest ponderosas I've ever seen. I made camp, washed my clothes, got cleaned up myself, and lazed about.

The fourth day I day-hiked up the canyon several miles and saw rattlesnake #3 on a sunny rock. He took off in a hurry and swam across the creek. I also saw more turkeys, and came across some sort of  foundation made with two six foot sections of heavy steel I-beams plus lots of rocks. There were a few sections of 4"" steel pipe headed off into the brush but I couldn't follow it very far. My guess is at some point there was a really big pump down there by the creek. It's all limestone in there, so it would not be related to gold mining. I don't know what they were pumping water for, unless it was going several miles to the CCC camp up on the plateau above the canyon.

I attempted to go for a swim as the daytime temps were in the 90s. Nope. Cold water was COLD. Got elbow deep, decided I didn't need to prove anything to anyone when I'm out by myself, and then departed the water in a hurry.

The fifth day I hiked up a side canyon and found a shallow cave under a ledge. It was maybe 6 feet tall at the entrance and pinched off about ten feet back. There was soot on the roof and charcoal mixed in the with the dirt on the ground, so I expect it was used as a shelter going back to prehistoric times. It as not really big enough for anyone to live in, though, and it was in a shady bend in the side canyon that would be icy cold in winter. However, for a summer hunting camp? I'm sure they took full advantage of it. I hung out there for half an hour eating a snack and enjoying the cool breeze coming from the cracks in the rocks.

The whole time I was hiking that day I was thinking, ""This is the perfect place to find a snake when it warms up."" And then it warmed up and I was like, ""Okay, now it's perfect conditions, perfect snake weather. BE CAREFUL."" And I was poking likely looking bushes with my hiking poles as I walked, and avoiding areas of tall lovegrass, and going around logs rather than stepping over them ...

... and I still damn near stepped on a very angry little rattlesnake, even though I was actively watching as I walked. He blended right in.

After detouring around the snake (poking him with my hiking stick failed to get him to move out of the way, he bit my stick) I headed back to camp on very high alert. That was snake #4.

I decided after seeing four rattlesnakes, and nearly stepping on one, it was time to bail on the trip. I was in no mood to keep exploring after the last close call. I've been going to this cabin since the 1980s and had seen zero rattlers up to this point.

The snakes will settle down after a week or two -- it was the first really warm weather of the year and they were coming out of hibernation and looking for a meal. In the meantime, however, it was just plain time to nope. I decided I'd leave the next morning.

The last afternoon I made crawdad tails in ramen -- I caught two dozen large crawdads with a piece of beef stick on a string, in under half an hour.

The last night, around 9 PM, I was awakened by the sound of an elk grunting and a bear bellowing, about a quarter mile away up the canyon. I have to say that I have never heard anything like that before, and I've backpacked and lived in remote areas for a few decades ... I've only ever heard elk grunt during the rut when they're fighting with each other. It was pretty alarming for awhile, but then all was silent.

In the predawn hours, the coyotes started up.

At dawn, the crows started cawing like they do when they've found carrion.

Hmm. I assume the bear got himself an elk.

I decided discretion was the better part of valor, and I cut a wide berth around the area by bushwhacking up the (fortunately not steep) hills. I gave it several hundred yards of room. I really didn't want to confront a bear on a yummy kill .. the local bears will usually run from people, but why take chances? I also made LOTS of noise as I traveled.

I hiked out without seeing any more snakes, and made an uneventful exit to my car.

Various observations and things I learned:

\-- I had a down sleeping bag with me, one of the ones with no down on the underside. In theory this saves weight, but I've decided I dislike this concept. The first two nights were cold (30s) and every time I moved I had to readjust the sleeping bag to cover me, because the lack of insulation on the bottom let in the cold. Lots of cold air leaks and it kept waking me up. The last three nights were in the 50s and 60s and the bag was too warm, but better a bag that's too warm than not warm enough.

\-- The plastic piezo button on my stove caught fire when I was boiling up the crawdads. I had an extra large pot, had piled rocks around it on three sides to protect it from the wind, and apparently there was too much heat for the plastic. It was a cheap stove and not a huge deal from a ""can I still use this"" standpoint. I just needed to light it with a match after that. However, I was glad I'd cleared a several foot area clean of pine needles, with the stove in the middle, because the spring inside the piezo launched the burning plastic a couple of feet from the stove. (Sproing!) It easily could have started a fire if I wasn't paying attention and/or hadn't cleared the area.

\-- Meat bees (yellow jackets) like crawdad tails more than anything else in the world. I knew this. I've known this a long time. Each time I cook crawdads I tell myself not to cook the crawdads in camp. It would be smarter to do it down by the creek. Each time, I go, ""How bad can it be?"" And then I cook crawdads in camp and I vow never to do that again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

\-- I had skipped taking a footprint for my tent, and used my poncho for a footprint, since it wasn't likely to rain. This meant I had nothing to sit on in camp other than rocks or the ground -- usually I unroll the poncho and use it as a picnic blanket. I have a habit of laying on my back and reading books in the shade in the heat of the afternoon. I got a lot dirtier without the poncho to lay on, and was generally unhappy sitting in the dirt. (I expect to get dirty when backpacking, but this was a bit excessive.) Next time I am taking the footprint and/or an extra poncho, it's worth the extra weight.

I'm going out this weekend to the same area for a quick overnight -- hopefully the snakes have found themselves meals and have quit wandering around where I might step on them.

I am experimenting on this next trip with just taking some Old Trapper beef sticks, dried fruit, granola bars, and candy rather than full meals. I find making a meal a nuisance. It also saves a lot of weight if I don't have to haul along a stove, fuel, and a mess kit.",survival

Question about backpacks,4,gwkzdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gwkzdq/question_about_backpacks/,10,1591317579.0,"Hello there !  
Recently i have thought of buying a backpack. I would want to use it for backpacking/hiking trips around my country this summer, and also use it for military ( In some cases, it is allowed in my country's national guard to use your own backpack, if you don't like issued one )  
The thing is, i would also like to use this backpack for prepping / bugout, surviving in outdoors in general, hence, the backpack must be neutral, so it doesn't attract much attention.  
At this moment i am looking forward to buy Camelbak Rubicon Mil-Tac backpack, since it would fit extremely well for outdoor backpacking and militry use, but major drawback is that it comes only in Multicam and Coyote, and these colors would attarct quite alot of attention, which is bad for survival situations.  
I would really appreciate your suggestions about which backpack in your opinion would be all-round best for these situations.  
Cheers !",survival

New York States or New Jersey. 

I can‚Äôt realistically carry ten days worth of water.

It will be my first time back packing, and I‚Äôm not sure which option is best. TLDR at the end.

weighing the following options: 1) boiling water each day, for daily use... 2) using a sawyer mini to filter out bacteria and UV to kill viruses.... or 3) a sawyer purifier to remove bacteria, viruses, and even chemicals pollutants.

1) Boiling water seems most foolproof, cheapest option, and effective for all pathogens. But it does nothing for non-organic contaminants like lead, etc. if oil go this route, how do I determine which water sources aren‚Äôt going to poison me with industrial runoff or some shit?

2) seems affordable, and user friendly. But doesn‚Äôt remove viruses. If I‚Äôm gathering water where other people have been ill probably guzzle noroviruses and get diarrhea in the wilderness. No thanks. But... how do I purify with UV? Just leave a clear bottle out in the sun while I hike? I mean, I can‚Äôt see UV so I can‚Äôt guess what it can penetrate- plastics, glass... what kind of bottle is conducive to UV sterilization?

3) most expensive option, but it seems almost entirely worth free. But I don‚Äôt want to spend money on a thing I can only use a couple hundred times or whatever and then have to replace.

4) I deliberately left the chemical tablets option off the list. I‚Äôm going to bring a few with me in case whatever other option I use as a first choice fails. But I hate the taste of chemically treated tap water so I don‚Äôt think I want to rely on that unless I really must.

5) I didn‚Äôt think of this until just now, but sunlight penetrates open water, if i only gather water from the top centimeter of a lake or something, would it be partially UV zapped? (I know currents constantly stir that shit up, just wondering if it makes any difference) 

6) I‚Äôve also thought about setting up a tarp trap for rain waters and what not, to refill a jug without needing to purify. But then I‚Äôm really at the mercy of the elements and i might try that for fun, but It wouldn‚Äôt be reliable as a plan A.

"Nine Day Trip, No Resupply, Northern Arizona -- Gear Photos",24,glokio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/glokio/nine_day_trip_no_resupply_northern_arizona_gear/,26,1589782237.0,"I've been backpacking since the 1980s, and like to do long trips. I thought I'd post some photos of my gear.

https://preview.redd.it/zf0fz92teez41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a55167b23cd938b816405d2a2c3996a8ab92dd60

I can guarantee some gram weenie is going to come on and comment about the weight of some of this stuff. I'm well aware I'll be carrying a lot of weight. Please note that I'm doing up to nine days without resupply, and I am NOT doing a lot of miles. My pack would look very different if this was a different kind of trip. 

Total pack weight inclusive of water and all food \~40-50 pounds. Haven't actually weighed it. Feels like a bag of feed when I pick it up. LOL.

The plan is to backpack in about three miles up a creek in Arizona's Rim country, set up base camp for 2-3 days and hike and explore the area. Then I'll move a mile or two up the creek, and rinse, lather, repeat, until I'm either tired of sleeping on the ground and scratching mosquito bites, or I have to go back to work. I expect I'll be out there something between seven and nine days. I will be surprised if I see anyone else; I'm going to be way off the beaten track. 

Also, note that I am planning on supplementing my meals with crawdads. This is why there is an extra-large pot and two cans of fuel. 

There is a fire ban -- campfires are not allowed.

I just wore a small hole in them finally, which is enough to let water in once you stand in a quarter inch of water or so. Soooo... not good.

My problem is that this is the first decent pair of boots I ever had. And I don't really know what is on the market that I should take a close look at, and what I should steer clear of. So, I thought I'd ask the Survival sub, since most of you are about getting the most out of any piece of gear you decide to use.

I am specifically looking for **hiking** boots, but they will be all purpose. I use them any time I think I might be stepping anywhere dirty, when I might be doing outdoor work, and so on. Also, of course, any time I go hiking, camping, or if any shtf scenario occurred. And when it is raining. Waterproof is absolutely necessary and non-negotiable. (And I don't really know about a steel toe, but my first impression is that I would prefer not to have one) All I'm really familiar with is Hi-Tec, which is what I am replacing. They were pretty good, though, I feel like they might have been a been bulky/heavy. And I can't help but wonder if boots can last a bit longer. Then, I am familiar with Columbia and Timberland... and North Face. Though, I have not had any products from any of them. I know Columbia jackets get high praise, but I don't know anything about the foot wear. 

I was just looking at a company called Danner, and another called Keen. But I don't really know anything about them.

I'm hoping you guys can offer me a push in the right direction on where to look? I am really not joking when I say I consider this to be my most important piece of survival equipment. Lt. Dan would agree. WWI showcased the importance of keeping your feet dry. And not to mention I grew up a westerner, where we wear shoes, so my feet are not at all adapted in any way where I could even think about trying to go barefoot outdoors on anything but soft grass. If I'm struggling to even walk, then getting shelter and water suddenly becomes a much harder task.

I really appreciate any and all input you guys have. This is a purchase that I will do quite a bit of research on before pulling the trigger on buying. I need to be sure I'm getting good quality. This last pair of boots I had cost me 60, I think my limit is 100, hard limit 120.",survival

Being prepared paid of last week,1440,io79si,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/io79si/being_prepared_paid_of_last_week/,125,1599513484.0,"I have gone on hiking trips for years now. And, being the paranoid guy I am, I was always over-prepared. I always carry a medium sized fixed blade knife. I always carry a first aid kit with bandages, painkillers and go-pills. I always carry some additional warm clothing and a rain jacket, no matter what the weather report says.

And other hikers told me I am an idiot. It's pounds of additional weight for nothing. And I did not give a shit. Better be prepared, just in case.

Last week my gf slipped on a tricky descent in the mountains. She broke her leg in 2 places and tore a ligament (she is actually in surgery right now and will get some screws into her leg to fix the bones). I set her down, put the warm clothes on her when she started shivering and went into shock. I gave her pain killers and the go-pills to get her up again. I cut down a small tree to make a walking aid and put a stick on her leg with the bandages to immobilize it. Then we spend an hour moving down the mountain, little by little, until we got to a clearing with cell phone reception and could call for help. She was evacuated by chopper.

So when people tell you that you are over-preparing and to not waste the weight, ignore them. Every piece of additional equipment I had on me, everything people had told me was useless, it all paid of that day.",survival

Almost Died On Sunday...,1062,gvn0b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gvn0b3/almost_died_on_sunday/,117,1591187360.0,"I have this high quality, 12 foot inflatable fishing boat. After investing in a medium sized motor, the stars aligned right, and I was able to go fishing on Sunday.

I decided to troll (drag a lure behind the boat) about 1-1.5 miles out, and then switch to bait fishing. I trolled about a mile offshore, got one of my poles set up and in the water, but on the calmest of days and in the actual middle of the ocean, I drifted into a reef. 

I turned my throttle to the fastest reverse setting, and in doing so, the current shifted me parallel just in time for a GOD DAMN rogue wave to hit me from the side, and flip my boat. Im fairly certain either the plywood flooring or the hinged top to my plywood storage box, hit me on the head and discombobulated me for like 10-15 second as I watched literally everything sink to the ocean floor.

I finally came to, and the first thing I decided was I needed to get my ""Oh Shit"" bag, I packed just in case something happened. So I swam to my storage box that was like 5 feet away from me, and grabbed my bag. I resurfaced, opened my bag, and pulled out my goggles and swim fins. I was underwater trying to get my fins on, but at the same time I was trying to keep the contents of my bag inside while I was getting smashed on on this reef.

I finally got everything on and figured that swimming to my boat, that was about 20 feet from me, was my best strategy to regain my bearing. When I was around 5-10 feet from the boat, I saw my storage box got tangled in my docking rope and was dragging behind the boat. I opened the lid to the box to see if anything was still inside, and the first thing I grabbed was the knife. Then I decided to grab my tackle box and some rope just in case. I swam to the boat with all that stuff just to realize that the 80 lb boat, was flipped upside down. Im not sure how, but on the first try I flipped the boat over, with ONE HAND!

I threw everything in the boat, and launched myself inside. After I laid there for a second to catch my breath, I sat up and didn't see any deep cuts or bleeds. I looked around to see how far I was from shore and to see if I could see any of my stuff. I saw my cooler, my life jacket, and a small red container, all spread out in different directions around 10ft feet from the boat. My paddles and motor were gone, and I knew I needed my life jacket and the water / food from the cooler. Unfortunately, the current was taking the life jacket in a different direction than me, but luckily, the cooler was about to float by me. As if nothing else could go wrong, the cooler was about 6 inches out of my reach.

I thought about what to do next and what my best chance of survival was. It was a toss up between packing what I could in my dry bag and swimming to the closest shore that was at least a mile away, or stay in the boat and either hope someone passes by me or hope the current took me towards land instead of out to sea. I decided that I had my fins and goggles, but also had confidence in my swimming ability (since I used to be a swimmer and remember the form for sidestroke, freestyle, backstroke, and breast stroke), so I thought it the best option would be to swim back. 

The physical part of swimming in the ocean wasn't as bad as the mental aspect. Once I cleared the reef, I notice the ocean floor rapidly dropping and I have never felt so unnerved in my entire life. What didn't help were the reoccurring cramps I kept getting in my left calf and hamstring. I couldn't stop my imagination from running a bit wild. I knew statistically that shark attack wasn't likely, but with the way I was cramping I couldn't stop myself from thinking I was like an endangered fish. I felt extreme sadness and regret because I knew if I died I wouldn't have left much to my son and wife.

I was about 150 yards from the shore when I saw a small boat about to pass by. I flagged them down, and they headed towards me, and helped me into the boat. The guy and his kids said they want to help me get my stuff back, so we found my boat, my cooler, and my life jacket. I lost my phone, GoPro, fishing poles, motor, and battery. I feel super shook right now. At some point I realized that I could have died and nobody would ever truly know what happened to me.",survival

Animal attack cheat sheet (for animals found in the PNW),570,itgzez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itgzez/animal_attack_cheat_sheet_for_animals_found_in/,155,1600230526.0,"I frequently go camping, hiking, or otherwise exploring. I‚Äôm insanely anxious and I always overthink my safety, so I‚Äôm sharing with you guys the list of techniques I‚Äôve made to avoid and/or survive attacks by some wild animals that we have here in the PNW.


COUGARS/MOUNTAIN LIONS-

If approached- Do NOT run. Do not turn your back to them, they are ambush predators. Make yourself look bigger to appear threatening. Maintain constant eye contact as you yell, make loud noises, and wave your arms about. Try to scare them off. Again, do NOT run as they will most likely attack.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. Try to remain on your feet and protect your head and neck. Fight back by any means possible. This means punching, kicking, any weapons you may have or nearby objects that can be used as a weapon.


BLACK BEARS-

If you see a black bear, respect its space. They will usually avoid you in turn as they are fairly timid. If you must pass them, give them a wide berth. They would rather flee than fight.

If approached- If you have children in your party, keep them close. Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand and face the bear directly. Speak calmly to identify yourself as something that is not a prey animal. If that does not work, make yourself look larger, and make loud noises to scare the bear away. Avoid direct eye contact.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. If you can escape to a safe location like a car or house, do it, but if not, then fight back. Black bears will not leave you alone if you play dead. Concentrate kicks and blows to the bear‚Äôs face and snout.


GRIZZLY BEARS-

If you see cubs, slowly back away. They are cute and may actually be intrigued by you, but do not interact since mama bear is probably close by and will certainly kick your ass. 

If approached- Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand tall and make yourself look large. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it is most likely just curiosity. Slowly back away with your bear spray in your hand. Ideal spraying distance is 40-50 feet.

If attacked- Lay down and do NOT fight back. This will intensify the attack as the bear is usually trying to neutralize you as a threat. Assume a fetal position, protecting your stomach with your knees, and lace your fingers behind your neck to protect it. If the bear stops attacking, stay ‚Äúdead‚Äù for at least 15-20 minutes because it will linger to see if you‚Äôre dead or just injured. If the bear is gone, back away slowly rather than running just in case they are watching from a distance. If the attack persists after you‚Äôve played dead, fight back only as a last resort, and aim for the bear‚Äôs eyes and snout.


WOLVERINE-

Wolverines have a reputation for being scary, but they are more likely to just throw a tantrum in order to scare you since bluffing is their forte. They are also not large- similar to a medium sized dog.

You will rarely encounter these in the wild since they are shy and solitary creatures. As far as I know, there are no cases of wolverines attacking humans. Just go back the way you came, or if you continue, give them space and keep an eye out. It‚Äôs unlikely that they‚Äôll hurt you.


PORCUPINE-

Porcupines are not often seen in the daytime as they are nocturnal and timid. They are short sighted and easily startled, so if you encounter a porcupine, walk a large distance around it if possible. They may swish their tail around which makes a strange noise, but unless you scare or threaten them, they are unlikely to quill you.

If quilled- remove them as quickly as possible so that the swelling doesn‚Äôt make it harder. Cut off the long end so that you can get a good grip on it and tug on it. If you can, do not twist or break it off. Do not use bare hands because this can injure your hand as well. If possible, wash the wounds well with soap and water and then apply antibiotic cream. Watch the wounds for redness, swelling, or itching. If you are quilled in the face or if the quills will not come out, see a doctor.

* We ran tests that measured sunlight and power output every 10 seconds, used a FLIR camera to check panel heat, and reconciled everything against official weather data from a nearby airport.¬†
* We found big differences between products and it wasn't clearly correlated with price or brand.¬†
* In fact, the ubiquitous Goal Zero products failed pretty hard, especially when considering they're 2-3X the price of the competition.
* Angle to the sun matters more than just about anything, as you can see in the orientation test results. You can get almost full power at 7 PM if angled right vs. almost no power if you hang the panel off your backpack at Noon.
* Panel size is another core factor. A cheaper big panel generally did better than a premium smaller panel ‚Äî especially in constant low-light conditions.
* Don't plug your phone / devices with built-in batteries directly in the panel while baking in the sun. Try to power a separate battery pack that you then use to charge your devices.¬†
* Similarly, prefer chargers without a built-in battery, rather than the combo units.¬†",survival

Cattail- and why it's the best survival plant (and why I love it).,540,7wbocp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/7wbocp/cattail_and_why_its_the_best_survival_plant_and/,69,1518187308.0,"DOUBLE EDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD YO! It's my first gold ever....what do I do?!?

Hi all! I'm new to the community and I wanted to share with you some of my foraging and wild edibles knowledge!

Firstly, as with all wild edibles, **PROPERLY RESEARCH IDENTIFICATION OF ANY PLANT FROM MULTIPLE TRUSTED SOURCES BEFORE INGESTING ANY WILD PLANT!** Many plants have dangerous lookalikes and can be toxic or deadly to humans.

Now that the warnings are out of the way..... CATTAIL

It's easily my favorite survival resource because it's readily available year round, easily accessible, and distributed widely. It can be found just about everywhere in the northern hemisphere. If you are near a pond, lake, river, or even very moist soil, you are almost certain to find cattail. 
It has a wide range of uses; food, tinder, weaving, basket and trap making just to name a few.

Cattail is INCREDIBLY nutrient-dense, containing Iron and Phosphorus, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin K, Vitamin B6, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium and Manganese. The pollen contains the bulk of the vitamins, with he roots containing the sugars and starches.

So let's start with identification:

* Cattail grows in aquatic, or semi-aquatic environments.
* Cattail is most commonly identified by the [signature cigar shaped flower](http://www.bjlaquascapes.com/uploads/2/5/7/1/25713565/3601478.jpg?428) atop the plants tall stalk.
* The leaves are blade like, hairless, and alternate on the single stalk it produces.

> **THERE IS ONE LOOKALIKE THAT MAY BE MISTAKEN FOR A YOUNG CATTAIL AND THAT IS [WILD IRIS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/9d4ca0cd-d1ed-4c13-93f9-6e3bf1176950_l.jpg)**

* [Wild Iris has an oval shaped stalk, whereas Cattail has a more rounded stalk](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NTJ1Pe264r8/Vy9RB1e-mvI/AAAAAAAAH0w/vvTdNANp8Q46skgiAnqRb6EsX68d0ocbgCKgB/s1600/IMG_2356.JPG)
* [Wild Iris leaves are also diamond shaped at the crossection, and Cattail leaves are curved](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1izrvJR3sqY/Vy9RKvuFAfI/AAAAAAAAH1M/kwO7ufOba5UbjM1rRqmrROFdH5MF-sMmwCKgB/s400/IMG_2358.JPG)

Once you are certain you have Cattail, you can harvest them! 
> **DO NOT HARVEST CATTAIL FROM ROADSIDES, DITCHES OR POLLUTED WATER SOURCES** Cattail acts as a filter in the environment, what ever it absorbs, YOU absorb.

*Many Species of cattail are invasive and widespread, choking out the natural flora of the habitat. They are hardy plants and are in no way in danger of being overpicked....so harvest away!*

In my experience, harvesting can go one of two ways, you could be wading ankle deep in mud pulling them out or you could stay clean and dry by using a shovel harvesting the plants on the shore. During the spring and summer when the water is warm, i'm content to go splashing around in the mud and water pulling the stalks from the mud. During the winter I'll take my trench shovel and dig the roots out.
The amount of usable parts of the plant depends on the season, In spring and summer, the roots, shoots, stalk, leaves and flower *(for food)* are all usable. This is the season where you'll get 75% of your use out of a cattail plant.
In the fall, your usable parts are cut down to the roots, shoots, leaves, flower *(for tinder)* and stalk. 50%
In the winter you are left with the roots, shoots and flower *(for tinder)* 25%

So before you start pulling up cattail, you should collect the pollen. I carry a small plastic container with a water tight seal to collect the pollen. Pollen collection is best when the cattail flower is SLIGHTLY yellow, and just a tad fuzzy, usually mid to late June. But this may vary in your area. you MUST keep an eye on these plants, they mature RAPIDLY usually within a few days. Once the flower turns brown, it is neither good for pollen or eating... Simply take the flower and shake it into your container, the yellow pollen will be collected! 
To harvest the cattail plant, grab the entire plant by the base and simply pull it from the mud. Pull straight up so you get the whole plant. Many cattail are interconnected by the roots, so bring a crappy knife with you to cut them. In the winter, or on the banks push your shovel into the soil around the whole plant and pull it from the ground. The root will rip, but harvest as much as you can. 

Processing 

* separate the roots and shoots from the stalk and scrub them clean from dirt, remove the smaller root-lets from the large main root.The small talon shaped shoots are gold. Discard any plant that has any noticeable mold (especially for winter harvesting). Like most aquatic plants in the area the cattail is also home to a beetle grub that fish like. On a green cattail look for an outer leaf that is brown at the bottom of the leaf and main stalk. You will find a grub, actually the larval form of an Arrowhead Beetle, fish LOVE these.
* separate the leaves from the stalk, you will notice a gel that is in-between the leaves. This gel is similar to aloe gel, but it has both antiseptic and analgesic properties. It's great for cuts and scrapes! Separate the leaves until you get to the main stalk.
* The core of the plant will be white at the bottom, and turn green as you go up the plant. The white parts are most tender, with the green being woody. I usually cut these 4-6 inches from the base, stopping at the middle point between green and white. If you've eaten woody asparagus, you know what i'm talking about.
* In spring, [before the flowers have matured](http://www.ediblewildfood.com/images/cattail-pictures/cattail-reproductive.jpg) and are still firm against the stalk you can cut these off and put them in your bag. The best ones IMO resemble corn on the cob. If the flower has matured, leave the sausage on the stalk and collect it for tinder.
* The remaining stalk and leaves can be used for weaving, mat making, basket and trap making, and tinder once dried. I have a pile of leaves at my camp, and a bundle of stalks that I am drying by the fire for caneing.

ONCE THE DIRTY WORK IS DONE....LETS COOK! 
**Cattail Flour can cause discomfort with those who have a gluten intolerance, and should be avoided by those with Celiac Disease**

* The roots can be eaten raw or roasted over a fire. Raw, they resemble a stalk of celery, but instead of crispy and watery, they have a runny mashed potato like texture. Raw, I usually peel the brown skin off and pull out the white fibers inside and chew on them like gum. They are wonderfully starchy and sweet, unlike anything I've eaten. Do NOT swallow the fibers, they aren't easy to digest. Also the fibers can get stuck in your throat and it's a pain in the butt. The roots can be mashed and separated from the fibrous bits similar to mashed potatoes and used as that, or a thickener. To harvest the starch for a thickener, crush them in clean water and let them sit. The starch settles to the bottom and you can pour off the water and fibers.
* The small shoots are GOLD and are best eaten raw, they are tender and delicious, makes a great garnish for a wild salad. I haven't cooked these yet because I love them raw.
* The core of the stalk is like an Udon noodle, with a slight crunch. I sautee these in my pan with a bit of oil and spices and it's a great veggie pasta! about 30-40 plants makes a decent sized dish.
* The immature flower can be boiled and eaten like corn on the cob....it even tastes like corn, but not like corn at the same time. It's for sure a unique flavor. 
* The pollen can be used as a thickener, or a very nutrient-dense booster to any meal, and adds a mildly sweet floral taste to your food. The flowers that have turned yellow and are slightly fuzzy can be stripped from the stalk into a separate container and can be used as a flour extender, or substitute. To use the flower on its own, you must process the starches from the roots to act as a binder and gluten to hold everything together. Mix these two into a dough, add spices and bake. TASTY!


So give it a try! Cattail is incredibly nutrient dense, filled with starch, and damn tasty. It's a valuable wild edible and it should be on your radar! Enjoy~

So there was a car accident outside my apartment building in downtown Philly. A 4-door car got got by an SUV and flipped, single passenger was trapped-- seatbelt on and upside down.

I happened to be one of the first people there and the driver is having a hard time getting out. I knew my folding knife that I keep in my pocket has a window punch and seatbelt cutter, so I go to work. [Knife](https://i.imgur.com/wKFZK2p.jpg)

I smash the window 3 or 4 different times with the window punch to no affect. Finally people on the other side of the car start saying the driver's out, so I go to put my knife back in my pocket when I realize my hand is all wet and sticky.

The seatbelt cutter dug into the meat of my thumb pad/palm and cut my hand open pretty damn deep. 6 stitches and a promise to make an appointment witha hand doctor and I'm back home.

These ""Practice Shelters"" are built all over Tahoe every year, and unfortunately a lot of them are left in place. Usually it is unpaid volunteers who have to clean up the mess. Just like this person pointed out, there was several shelters left over already. If their shelters were never disassembled, the forrest would be full of them. 

>It would be on the ground in a pile once we disassembled it anyways so what's the harm in leaving it?

Please, if you care about your forrest, help us maintain it for the next thousand years. When you are done with your shelter, **scatter the remains**. This shouldn't take you more than a few minutes.

I was in a pretty serious car accident in the middle of nowhere and told you might want to hear my story.,484,5dqas2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/5dqas2/i_was_in_a_pretty_serious_car_accident_in_the/,81,1479549976.0,"I originally posted this in r/askmen about ""worst experiences ever.""  I was messaged that the folks at r/survival might want to hear about my experience, so here goes nothing.

**TL:DR** Jeep accident in the middle of nowhere.  [Pictures here](http://imgur.com/gallery/mu1ct)

Had a dream job as a seasonal employee at a National Park.  Went out on a jeep trail with a buddy.  We leave the park and I came to a fork in the road, I chose the more difficult one.  After several miles of crazy trail, I mean literally one of the craziest roads I've every traversed in 10 years of owning and using a jeep, we cross a stream, and go up a hill, right on the edge of a cliff.  The roads is suddenly smooth, there are no more boulders and dropoffs to navigate, so of course I say, ""looks like we're in the clear!""  

Then suddenly, the jeep starts to tilt, my buddy starts screaming ""Oh god, oh god.""  I look at him as we are leaning, all I can see is a cloud of dust through his open doorway, and then, we are gone.  The road has collapsed along the cliff edge. We roll about 35 feet down the cliff, it's a full barrel roll.  It seemed to happen in slow motion, I'm staring straight ahead, gripping the steering wheel, just waiting this out, listening to the loud **CLANGS** as the sides and roof roll and hit the cliff, and then we're freefalling and **BAM!!!** The windshield spiderwebs, the passenger side wheel pops, and I'm blinded for a second by the most intense glare in my life.

I'm wide awake, the glare gradually fading away, and it feels like I had just been gut punched harder than anyone in history, and I am just sucking in the wind that was knocked out of me for like two minutes.  Once that's over, I know I'm hurt bad in my back.  I had suffered a slipped disc weightlifting years before and figured I just aggravated it worse than it had ever been.  I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and lay my seat back as far as it will go in a desperate attempt to get flat, and just want to wait for the pain to go away all while thinking, ""This is actually happening, I'm so fucked, I'm so fucked"". My buddy is hurt worse, he's slumped over and bleeding on my shorts.  

Now, while I'm worried about my friend, I'm also in so much pain he's not my priority, but he starts to moan in pain and I am so relieved.  He comes to, he's in a ton of pain and begs me to lay his chair back.   In fact, he starts to freak out, because he can't feel his legs, he can barely move.  

Mentally I'm freaking out, I don't want to even think about the P-word.  I tell my buddy to stay calm and not to move.  I struggle to get out of my jeep, the pain is crippling.  I make my way over to the passenger side, manage to pull out the back seat of my jeep that had popped out and lean my buddy's seat back.  I collapse from the pain on the bank of the stream, and lie there for a few minutes until the red ants start to swarm me and I force myself to get up.  I get back in the jeep, but not before filling an empty nalgene bottle with dirty stream water, it tastes like we were in a cow pasture (fun fact, we were).

Anyway, I'm lying down and thinking about how fucked this is.  I'm telling my buddy, ""This is **SO** fucked.""  We are miles from civilization on a pretty obscure, unmaintained jeep road, and there's no phone service.  Because we're not total idiots me and my buddy had shared our general plan with his girlfriend (who also worked at the park) that if were not back by 10 p.m, were in trouble.  Well, this accident happened around 6:15 p.m.  I'm in a ton of pain and thinking, ""I'll wait an hour, then get help, I want to rest.""

Meanwhile my buddy (who ironically enough completed Search and Rescue training that day) starts asking if his chair can be leaned back anymore.  I tell him no and he goes ""ok, ok, no worries man"" but in 30 seconds he asks again if I can lean his chair back more.  Red flags go off in my head, I'm thinking concussion.  I spend the next 30 minutes telling him over and over again his chair can't be leaned back anymore.  Eventually he starts asking what happened.  ""We rolled off a cliff,"" I tell him.  ""We rolled off a cliff?"" he asks.  ""Yes about 25, 30 feet"" I say.  ""Well, how about we drive out of there?"" is his next question. ""The jeep is fucked,"" I say.  ""Does anyone knows where we are?"" is the third question. ""Yes, your girlfriend back in Fruita."" I tell him.  ""I have a girlfriend?"" is his reply.  I tell him she'll know something is up at 10 p.m.  After I answer these questions for him, he contemplates the situation, and asks again ""What happened?""

So yeah, I'm like 100% sure he has a concussion.  I answer his questions again.  And again.  I decide I can't get help now, between the inability to move and head injury, my buddy can't be left alone.  I also think we'll be rescued later that night, so I tell him we just have to wait until 9 for his girlfriend to freak out and tell the Law Enforcement rangers, and then a few more hours until they find us.  I tell him we just have to wait, and then he's going to enjoy the best helicopter ride and have an amazing hospital room.  He asks again what happened, and I we go through his question cycle for a few hours more, only being interrupted by him occasionally freaking out that he can't feel his legs.

During this time I find an emergency kit I keep in my car, filled with two emergency blankets, glow sticks, hand warmers (that don't work), a dead flashlight, and a whistle.  Even though it's still warm, we're in high desert terrain, and I know it will be in the 40s that night.  The jeep doesn't have doors or windows (though the soft top is up) and we're both wearing t-shirts, shorts and flip flops.  I try my best to wrap him in the blanket, and also give him a wool cap and gloves I have in a duffel bag I keep in my car.  I wrap myself up too as the darkness gradual falls.

In the distance we begin to hear a lot of loud Moo's.  My buddy starts freaking out.  The public land were in is open pasture for cattle, and we are spooking a nearby herd.  I can't see that well through the spider-webbed windshield and the sunset, but apparently they are nearby.  My buddy thinks we are going to be attacked, but I tell him we'll be fine.  Truthfully, I am worried, since spooked cows might act defensive if they feel threatened, we both really can't move, and how embarrassing would that be to survive a fall off a cliff to get killed by fucking scared cows?  I honk the horn of the jeep, and I never see any cows as it becomes dark, but we do hear them for a couple hours more.

So yeah, basically the evening consisted of my answering the same exact questions from my buddy, who has no idea he's even a park guide, let alone out in a western national park.  I'm in pain and just telling myself only a few hours more, a couple hours more, an hour more, and now people should know that something's up.  Even though 10 P.M. was our ""get nervous"" time for his girlfriend, I was confident she'd be freaking out by 9 P.M and we'd be rescued soon.

Around 10 I am listening for anything.  I start honking the horn.  Anytime I hear a plane or helicopter I flash the brights on my jeep.  I keep trying to call 911 because even with no service there can be a small chance it'll connect to a tower in emergency situations.  It starts to get cold.  My buddy says his feet are freezing, he keeps pulling up the emergency blanket and I can't fix it, because when I lean over the pain is so intense I want to throw up, but a few times I feel sympathy and decide to suffer through getting the blanket properly wrapped around my injured buddy.  I also pull out a big map of the park and surrounding areas, and try to put it over his feet, as well as my empty duffel bag.  It's cold, but I know it's not cold enough for us to freeze to death or suffer frostbit, but every little bit will make us slightly more comfortable.

Through the night, I gradually lose patience, between answering the same questions over and over and over and over and over and over again, and because my buddy keeps messing up his blanket, and it is so, so painful to try and fix.  He constantly is trying to adjust his body on his seat, we both wish we could be lying completely flat but our seats only lay back so far; he screams in pain, and then freaks out because he realizes out he can't feel his legs.  He keep forgetting this fact all night, and it is a shitshow every 20 minutes.  I observe him, he can move his legs and feet to an extent, so I'm feeling more positive he's not paralyzed, but I know it's still a huge deal and he should be staying steal.  I stick an arm under his blanket, and demand he grab it with his hands, to keep us a little more warm and to keep him still.  We lie back, in the cold night, him tightly clutching my arm as I press down on his chest in a desperate attempt to stay warm and keep him still.

Around 1 am, I come to conclusion that rescue will not be happening tonight.   I still flash my brights every time I think there's a plane or helicopter flying overhead, but I figure it's meaningless. I'm freezing cold, in a ton of pain, and am at my whits end answering the same questions over and over and over again.  Actually, I begin to snap at him, ""I've answered this question at least 200 fucking times, and you're going to forget it in 5 minutes.""  He's taken aback. ""Sorry buddy, sorry buddy,"" he meekly replies, before I apologize and tell him he won't remember this conversation in 5 minutes anyway.  And so it go's for another few hours. At least it's a new conversation to add to the cycle.  I'm annoyed that we're not going to rescued soon. I tell my buddy to think of warm hospital beds and how great that helicopter ride is going to be.  I keep honking the horn at this point to keep us awake.

Anal urination for hydration?,480,6ai35l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/6ai35l/anal_urination_for_hydration/,199,1494507546.0,"So, I've heard that drinking your own urine can hydrate you in specific circumstances. Like if it's not already-recycled urine, it should be fine.

I've also heard that enema's can hydrate you. Something about the colon retaining water.

Now for the big question: can you combine these two things into one? Basically, can you administer urine through the anus to bypass the urine's unpalatability?

Let's say me and my friend are in the woods. We're lost. He/she is really thirsty and feeling faint and I have to pee really badly.

Basically, can I hydrate the poor bastard by shoving my dick up his/her ass and emptying my bladder into his colon?

Like, wouldn't this be reliable when you take into account urine's unpleasant taste that might induce vomiting, leading to worse dehydration?

EDIT:
I'm not in this situation now, I've just been pondering about it for months.

Penn State says wilderness is too risky for outdoors clubs,431,8eeuds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/8eeuds/penn_state_says_wilderness_is_too_risky_for/,98,1524545509.0,"STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) ‚Äî A near-century-old outdoor recreation club will now refrain from going outside because it is too dangerous out in the wilderness, according to officials at Penn State University.

The Penn State Outing Club, originally founded in 1920, announced last week that the university will no longer allow the club to organize outdoor, student-led trips starting next semester. The hiking, camping and other outdoors-focused activities the student-led club has long engaged in are too risky, the university‚Äôs offices of Student Affairs and Risk Management determined.

Richard Waltz, the Outing Club‚Äôs current president, said that the decision was made by an office that never consulted them.  The decision was based on a two-month review that didn‚Äôt include consultation with student leaders at any of the clubs deemed too risky, according to students.  Two other outdoor recreation clubs ‚Äî the spelunking Nittany Grotto Caving Club and the Nittany Divers SCUBA Club ‚Äî also have been directed to end trip offerings.

‚ÄúSafety is a legitimate concern, but it wasn‚Äôt an open dialogue,‚Äù Waltz said.  Christina Platt, the Outing Club‚Äôs incoming president, said, ‚ÄúI can hardly blame Penn State for protecting itself against further litigation after a number of high-profile scandals in the past decade.‚Äù  Student safety is the school‚Äôs primary focus, university spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in a statement.

Penn State conducted a ‚Äúproactive risk assessment‚Äù not based on any previous participant injuries, according to Powers. She said Outing Club activities were rated high risk because they take place in remote environments with poor cell service and distance from emergency services.",survival

A PSA rant on hiking boots.,385,8mvn40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/8mvn40/a_psa_rant_on_hiking_boots/,110,1527590620.0,"Having good boots on your feet can make all the difference when you're trying to cover some distance in the wild, especially with weight on your back. I sold hiking boots for 6 years. During that time I had some top notch training along with many opportunities to pick the brains of the engineers, physicians, manufacturers and designers of many of today's top boot makers. I can't just sit here and type words that'll make you a fitting expert, but I can provide some good guidelines and dispel some of the most common misconceptions. I'll try to keep the categories neat, but I reserve the right to invoke 'rant privilege' at any time. Just to get some common terminology out of the way - a boot typically has four main parts, the upper (covers the top of your foot and ankle), the outsole (which is against the ground), the midsole (which provides the main structure and contour under your foot) and the insole (which your foot directly sits on). 

**Ankle Support**. The first and most important misconception to get out of the way is the notion that hiking boots that cover your ankles provide ankle support. They do not. Unless you're talking about plastic shell mountaineering boots or a medical ankle brace, you are not getting structural support for your ankle. The reason higher hiking boots cover your ankle is to provide protection from scrapes and other abrasions. If you've ever scraped your ankle bone along the side of a rock, you'll see the value in having this feature. Most boot uppers are actually designed specifically to be flexible around your ankle, which is inherently antithetical to ""supporting"" it. That flexibility is important because your ankle needs to be able to move for you to walk normally, comfortably and with little resistance. An additional benefit to having a higher upper is that you can make the boot more water resistant higher up so you can step in deeper puddles or mud. Even stiffer uppers that cover the ankle typically do not offer actual support - a bit like how a lifting belt does not enable you to lift more, it just reminds you to maintain better posture. If you think of your ankle as the fulcrum and your entire body (plus any pack you're wearing) as the lever, you'll get why the physics just don't add up for ankle support. The amount of torque on your ankle far exceeds anything some flexible leather can stop. It would be like supporting your broken arm with toilet paper - not realistic or practical. So do not look to your boots to provide ankle support because you won't get any. If you REALLY do need ankle support, then you need a medical ankle brace, not taller boots.

**About Insoles**. The insole is what marries your foot to the midsole and structure of the boot. It is very typical for manufacturers to provide a very generic one-size-fits-most slightly cushy insole. This is because it's both cheaper and allows the boot to feel better during an initial try-on for the maximum range of feet. However, these insoles very rarely work out to be in your foot's long-term best interest. Squishy insoles do not provide your feet with the feedback they need to react properly to the ground. That feedback is what keeps your gait appropriate to the terrain you find yourself on. Stiffer insoles that conform properly to your foot can both provide better feedback and help marry your foot to the shoe better. This can reduce how much flex you get from 'fallen arches' (a whole topic of misconception I won't even touch) and also reduce general floating around in the boot, which you don't want to fix with tighter laces (I'll get to that). A better foot to boot connection often means less soreness in your feet, fewer blisters and fewer damaged toes and toenails. You don't need to go get $400 custom made podiatrist hand-molded insoles. You can get a pair of Superfeet for like $40 that fit your foot properly and far better than the generic insoles - plus they last long enough to migrate through 3-4 pairs of boots and actually do provide arch support. DO NOT get those ridiculous gel squishy pads because your feet hurt - I will find you and slap you.

**Lacing**. All too often I see people slide their foot into a boot fresh from the box, crank down the laces as tight as they can and then bitch and moan about how the upper feels. For one thing, you do not want the laces to be too tight over your metatarsals (the long bones along the top of your foot). You can reduce blood flow which is important for nerve function and temperature regulation.  Another consideration is quite simply foot-shape. You should have roughly a thumbnails width of space between the front of your big toe and the front of the boot. If the boot is the wrong shape for your foot, then just accept it and move on. If, however, the overall shape is good but the heel slides just a bit, or there's a mild pressure point on top of your metatarsal, or you need to control a bit more tightness up high while not letting the toe-box tighten up, or some other small adjustment, then there are tons of lacing techniques that can help. Just do a google image search for ""Boot lacing techniques"" and you'll see what I'm on about. I've gone back to some old boots that I almost gave up on and gave them new life with new insoles and lacing adjustments. 

**Socks**. OK, this is not technically about the boots themselves but it's important damn it. I don't care what Les Stroud said in the Georgia Swamp episode, DO NOT wear cotton socks. Unless you have a wool allergy, wear wool. You can get thinner wool that does not get too hot in the summer and wool breathes and wicks better than cotton so don't give me that 'it's too hot' crap. Yes, it's fairly expensive, especially for the good stuff, but you'll only need a couple pairs. Cotton will stink, stifle and is far more likely to induce blisters. If you do have a wool allergy, then there are some very good synthetic options out there too. Just don't wear cotton or I swear I will absolutely slap the crap out of you.

**Consider weight**. Now that I'm all fucking worked up I'm going to do you a favor and probably save you some money and grief. Most people end up buying shoes that are over built for what they need. The two main materials midsoles are made of are PU (polyurethane foam) and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate). PU is heavier and typically used more in hiking boots. It's stiffer and lasts longer but is also more expensive and heavier. EVA is softer and cheaper but breaks down more quickly. EVA is more often associated with running shoes. Many boots have a mix of both - if your boot salesperson does not know what the midsole is made of,.. slap them. Most day hikers and light packers can get away with trail running shoes, which are just running shoes with a knobbier outsole. More weight and more distance does require more structure in most cases, but not all. I recommend: When in doubt, go with the lighter option. Spending more money to pick up those extra 6 ounces every step can really add up to a big difference. 

If anyone has questions or tips to share, please do. Foot-care is important to anyone who needs to walk a long distance, but especially those who MUST cover many miles with weight on their back. Even a small blister can add to your misery bucket and when you're trying to focus on getting out, getting to water, gathering wood or whatever you need to do before that sun sets, you really don't want to suddenly have foot issue to worry about. Then you're slapping yourself.

"Secrets to finding flint in areas where experts say there is no flint. It's a good survival skill to have- The ability to pick up a rock and make a tool, or use it to make fire. Flint and chert are highly prized for this. But what if you live in an area where ‚Äúeveryone says‚Äù there is none?",361,ihm6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ihm6yj/secrets_to_finding_flint_in_areas_where_experts/,31,1598567955.0,"One example is where I live-  New Hampshire, US.  Most of the sources say that there is no flint or chert to be found here.  The reason for that statement is that the sedimentary rock was scoured away by glaciers, and is now out in the ocean somewhere.  Almost all flint and chert is biological in origin, so it's found in sedimentary rock such as limestone.  There is no sedimentary bedrock here, so therefore no flint (or so they claim).  That statement is true, but only in a general sense.  You will not find it in the bedrock or exposed ledge.  You won't find large deposits of it.  But you can find it in the woods, and here are a few secrets -

Those same glaciers that scoured away our sedimentary bedrock also brought in rocks from far away.  Because of this one geologist wrote that you might find just about any kind of rock in New Hampshire.  The context was he was writing to the general public.  It wasn't a formal paper to fellow academics.  Still, his general observation was an amazing variety of rocks, so he wrote that you might find almost any kind of rock here.  And I would say this applies to a very large area, not only the small state of New Hampshire.  I believe that most of the North American continent was covered by glaciers at one time.  That means that flint or chert may have been brought there by glaciers from far away.

Where should you look for chert?  Look in stream and creek beds.  Ones with a fast current are better because it tends to keep the rocks clean from algae, moss, and other vegetation.  Also look alongside the trail and along the road.  Let's face it-  It's much easier to find rocks on the surface of the ground than dig for them.  Mining is a lot of work, obviously.  When you find a rock that you suspect to be chert, you may have to break it open in order to identify it.

Another place to look for chert is along old Indian trails and areas settled by them.  One way that rocks move is by being carried by humans.  The American Indians had an extensive trade network, and one commodity was chert.  Many roads and trails in the US were originally Indian trails.  Some of these can be found in old records.  But most (I believe) you would have to find by talking to people or knowing how to recognize them.  You can also learn to identify likely settlements.  This topic I plan to address later.

The last secret I want to go over today is finding lost or discarded gun flints.  Poor people used flintlocks in rural areas long after the invention of percussion firearms and even cartridge ammunition.  So you might find flint in and around old cellar holes, and also in hunting areas.  Certain vantage points have always been good for hunting with a firearm.  If you see a tree stand, spent casings, etc on a ridge if you look carefully you might find flint as well.

Before I sign off, I would like to thank Jay of Vision Quest Outdoors for his help.  I also thank him for challenging me to go out and find chert in the woods.  Check out his Youtube channel if you get a chance.

I hope this helps you.  I also want to give you a challenge.  I'm calling it Chert Quest 2020.  Go out and try to find chert in your area, especially if it is an area where people say it doesn't exist.

God bless!

Doug

I don't know how people are so calm out in the wilderness. Wildlife seems to be my only fear out there.

Taking the mental side out of the equation, I've been reading a bit about just precautions and defense tips. Bells are a good call since sneaking up on anything is a bad idea and it seems like bear spray is the way to go. I've thought for a time a gun would be the safest, and I'm glad I'm wrong. Not only is it dangerous (that I knew) and not really allowed for casual campers, but seems like defence with bear spray has a much higher success rate.

Perhaps it's like sharks for some people. I don't have a fear of them since they rarely attack people. And if they do it's generally accidental. Yet many are terrified.

 I live in Vancouver BC, Canada.

And it's kind of silly, because I'm certainly not the most experienced guy here. I'm still learning a lot. I've got a whole list of skills I want to practice this summer, stuff I've never done before. So let me get that out of the way- I'm by no means some sort of expert here.

That said, I keep seeing a trend here and in several other survival-related subs. (/r/bushcract, /r/preppers, /r/survivalist, etc.) I think this trend is perpetuated by a lot of folks like myself who aren't really experienced in these sorts of things.

So here's what happens- someone comes along with a new way of McGuyvering some old survival task with less-than-optimal equipment, or a method of building some critical tool from field-sourced materials, something along those lines. Next thing you know, you see people including those items in their *prepared survival kits*. I am completely stunned by this.

In the two most recent examples I can think of, I saw a guy who was putting together a ""bug out bag"" and, for his firemaking materials, included a couple 9V batteries and a handful of steel wool. There's also a link in /r/bushcraft about how to make broadheads from scrap metal. The guy in the video mentions that he keeps a few of these jimmy-rigged, suboptimal devices in his kit.

I guess I understand if this is all you can afford, or all you can get your hands on, etc. But if that's not the case, and you actually felt like broadheads were something you really wanted to put in your kit, why wouldn't you purchase some actual, commercial, well-made broadheads instead of something you cobbled together from scraps? Why would you include steel wool and batteries in your kit instead of, you know, a lighter and ferro rod?

This is a great example of ""knowledge weighs nothing"". These techniques are great to practice a couple times, and keep in the back or your head for when such a situation presents itself, when you have that equipment or something like it and can use that technique. But for Christ's sake, don't stake your life on those methods if you have easy access to the proper tools for the job.

If I'm out of line here, please, someone let me know.",survival

One thing I noticed when I'm out in the woods is how weather can affect our situation. Along the years I remember getting caught by rain or storms and saying wow... I could, and should have seen that coming. Either that or you think the storm of the century is coming but it end up breaking apart and doing nothing, you just stressed out for nothing. 

I began reading on the subject maybe 3-4 years ago and got hooked! From there I was studying because I simply enjoyed it not even for survival anymore but since then, I was amazed at how many time it changed my priority when practicing in the bush and simply avoided me additional struggle. Not only in the bush, everywhere ! You end up seeing important detail people don't that make all the difference. The fact that you can read the sky and not depend on media or someone else is an amazing feeling as well, you feel even more in connection with nature when you understand weather.

For so long I searched info on the net but found out that the vast majority of them were giving very little detail. I ended up buying books but finally found ... the bible of meteorology, I was so happy. I watched every chapter like 5 time and I understand that you have to be super motivated. 

So I found ONE chapter, that if you watch, you will have a good base of knowledge, enough to ... know what to look for and know if there is a high risk or low risk. The person doing the video has a lot of knowledge, I believe this is a teacher in Arizona or something.

I created a playlist with all the other chapter, if you have interest in this I really suggest you to watch other chapter, you have enough stuff to study for months :) This link bring you directly to the most important one (Chapter 7 1/2) for us case but all the other one are following.

R/Survival is turning into Backpacking for Dummies.,276,1fe2zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/1fe2zs/rsurvival_is_turning_into_backpacking_for_dummies/,92,1370011209.0,"This sub has so many stories of people purposely going out into the bush/woods/wild unprepared and getting into danger, which frankly is just plain stupid. Even Les Stroud himself said the biggest myth about survival is that it is fun. Real survival is not fun. Practicing fire-making, bushcraft, trap making, etc. can be fun, and can be learned without risking your life with a hobby called [Backpacking](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-beginners.html).

Bring the [10 Essentials](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html) and learn how to use them.

The most important thing to have with you when spending the night outside is a sleeping bag. Not a gun, not a knife, not a tent, not even clothes or food or water. Exposure will kill you faster than dehydration or starvation. (If it rains, however, you're fucked. So bring a tarp or at least a trash bag for rain protection). To sleep comfortably, go ahead and pack a tent and sleeping pad as well.

Practice Leave No Trace (LNT). Making debris shelters by chopping down trees, then leaving them there once you are done, is a waste of natural resources and an eyesore to other people trying to enjoy the outdoors. And if you leave your trash in the woods, fuck you.

Carrying 50lbs (or more) of gear that you won't use is a bad idea. You'll only be able to walk a few hundred yards before getting fatigued. Learn to adopt some /r/ultralight techniques. Doing this will allow you to travel faster and further, thus enjoying more of the outdoors, and gain a greater sense of accomplishment (like bagging peaks, etc.). I suggest you read [this whole series of articles](http://www.backpackingnorth.com/p/ultralight-makeover.html).

A few things that gave me laughs in the stories I've read recently:

-Bringing a 9 volt and steel wool to start fire. Instead, bring a Bic lighter and petroleum jelly cotton balls. Bring a ferro rod and waterproof matches as backup. Save that 9 volt trick for when your plane crashes over the Amazon.

-Making a water filter using sand and charcoal. Just bring any number of commercially available filters, or chemical treatment like Potable Aqua, Aquamira, iodine, etc. Again, save the tricks for when your ship sinks and you end up on a deserted island.

-Not bringing any food or water. C'mon, really?

Bring on the downvotes if you think I sound like an asshole, but some of you people need to use some common sense when you venture outdoors.

Edit. TL;DR: Be prepared. Don't be unprepared. ",survival

I'm looking for any information and resources on how to get by in a water scarce suburban environment.

Where to source my own water (rivers, groundwater, dew harvest etc) and how to treat it.

I don't think this is going an actual life or death survival exercise, but I don't want to suffer.

Yakima County Deputy Rob Hubbard, who was recently trained by Combat First Aid, saved this man's life last Thursday. The 28 year old man was hunting solo in the remote wilderness when he fell and dropped his muzzleloader. When the muzzleloader hit the ground, it discharged, sending a .58 cal round into the front of his right forearm. The bullet traveled through his arm at an upward angle and exited just above his right elbow. The hunter tried to fashion a tourniquet with his belt, but when Deputy Hubbard found him, his skin was pale and the wound was still bleeding. Deputy Hubbard applied a CAT Tourniquet on the man's upper arm and saved his life. He was flown by helicopter to a trauma center where Doctors confirmed the man would have bled to death if Deputy Hubbard had not applied the tourniquet. Outstanding work!"" From FB",survival

He argues that meditation allows him to withstand colder temperatures and has used it to help him survive disease. There have been some academic studies surrounding his style of meditation arguing that by consciously hyperventilating while meditating in a style of meditation called ""Tummo"", he's able to increase his heart rate, his blood alkalinity and adrenaline levels. 

He holds 26 world records [including one for the longest ice bath.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof)

He climbed to 6.7 miles in altitude (22,000 feet) with nothing but shorts and shoes. He's completed a full marathon above the arctic circle in Finland in -20 degrees.

This is something you don't see many survivalists talking about, but I'm confident that it can help us endure more than just cold temperatures, but stressful situations where emotions can cloud our vision and impact the way we make decisions.

Bears!,253,hcycbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hcycbt/bears/,70,1592732645.0,"I originally wrote this as a comment to another post. There are so many posts on here about ""I'm new to the wilderness what's up with bears?"" I figured I'd post this as it's own sticky post. This is geared towards new people and there are exceptions to most of what I say. Nothing is gospel in survival. Even the best trained and most experienced outdoorsmen sometimes come home in body bags. I would love to hear from anyone about mistakes I made or things I left out, although remember this is a post targeted at beginners so it's main aim is to give people a set of basic, easy to follow guidelines to minimize the chance of being injured or killed by a bear.

Now, here is my comment, repurposed as this post:

When you see a bear give them a big hug, they are famous for hugging!

Seriously though, wild camping is actually a very very safe hobby. Considering the amount of people that take to the wild every year it's not actually that big of a deal to camp in bear country. Black bears are by far the most common bears to encounter. Between 1997 and 2017 there were 25 fatal black bear attacks in North America https://www.wideopenspaces.com/list-fatal-black-bear-attacks-north-america-last-20-years/ and also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America To put that in context, in just Yellowstone National Park in only the year 2018 there were 4.1 million visitors. The best place to start for safety in bear country in the US is here: https://www.nps.gov/articles/bearattacks.htm The most comprehensive book is still *Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance* by Herrero https://www.amazon.com/Bear-Attacks-Their-Causes-Avoidance/dp/149302941X

Basically there are 3 rules.

1st give them their space.

2nd don't mess with their cubs.

Those are obvious.

The 3rd and most important one is food. The vast majority of adults who get hurt by black bears do so because the bear was seeking the person's food and the person got hurt in the process. Make 3 separate spots: one for camping/sleeping one for cooking one for food storage. Don't bring food into your campsite or cook in your campsite. If possible the cooking and food storage sites should be downwind of the campsite so that the bear doesn't wander through your camp seeking your food. This may not be possible in areas with variable winds. Hang up your food or use a bear canister. If you hang your food don't just lazily hang it over a tree branch. Use two pieces of cordage tied to the food bag and suspend the bag at least 15' above the ground and 10' from either tree, by tying a rock to each piece of cordage and tossing it over a branch and then hoisting the bag up. Hang all smelly stuff, not just food: toothpaste sunscreen etc.

Here's a pic of what I mean from a duckduckgo search https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hang+bear+bag&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outsidebozeman.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Flarge%2Fpublic%2FBearBag.jpg%3Fitok%3D_xfgGO_O

There's other ways of doing it but that's the best one. The PCT method is 2nd best. Hang your bear bag in an area that is surrounded by open spaces so you can see whether or not the food is still hanging that way you don't walk up on them while they are munching on your GORP. Even with all the tricks I gave bears still mights get your food because they are real smart. Bear canisters or certain models of UrSak are probably the best overall but are expensive and bulky and don't hold much. You could always just store your food in your car.

If you encounter a black bear on the trail and it doesn't run away (or more likely meander away grumbling to itself) first option is to make yourself big and obvious, wave your arms, yell, etc. ***DO NOT RUN AWAY OR TURN YOUR BACK***. If you encounter a grizzly bear yelling and waving may provoke a defensive attack; look around to try to spot any cubs (you want to move away from the cubs not towards them and when startled the cubs may freeze, being furry and brown they are not that obvious) then back away slowly while keeping the bear in sight. Do not look the bear in the eyes. If the bear charges just throw it your backpack so it can have your food. Seriously. You can buy more Clif Bars. It's not worth getting injured or killed. If the bear is charging and throwing your backpack doesn't work then stand your ground. Use your bear spray or firearm if you have it ready. ***DO NOT RUN FROM A CHARGING BEAR***. Most charges are bluffs, running from a bluff may change the bluff attack into a real one. After the bear bluff charges return to backing away while keeping the hear in sight. Refer to my later section for differences between blacks and grizzlies regarding actual attacks.

Guns and bear spray are good options for defense if you are attacked. Of the two bear spray is objectively superior even among seasoned firearms users. For most people carrying a gun in the woods is more dangerous than any bear. However if you are experienced in handling and utilizing firearms they can be good options. If you aren't I would recommend against it. Neither are necessary if all you've got is black bears but they still might be wise depending on the bear activity in your particular area. In grizzly country you should carry bear spray even if you carry a firearm: either bear spray alone or bear spray + gun. When carrying bear spray do not carry it in your backpack. Carry it in a holster that you can access with one hand without looking at it. Practice drawing the bear spray from it's holster and presenting it several times before each trip so you can discover any problems, for example if it gets caught in your shirt or if it gets covered by your backpack's waist belt you need to address that. Practice while wearing your full kit and the clothes you hike in.

In black bear country .357 mag is the preferred choice among most. In grizzly country  it's classically been .44 mag but the current trend is toward 10mm. Most bear attacks that have been stopped by firearms have been stopped by 9mm using self defense rounds, simply because 9mm is the most common pistol caliber people carry for self defense. There are several recorded instances of grizzly bears being killed with .22lr.

If you are attacked by a black bear it's likely predatory so fight back with everything you have. Even if it's only your fists. If you are attacked by grizzly bears it's likely defensive so play dead by assuming the fetal position and covering your neck and head with your arms and hands as best you can.

I really don't like bear bells. There is no evidence they work and they scare off all the other wildlife and ruin it for other hikers. Major outdoor educators such as NOLS and Outward Bound have done away with bear bells in their classes even in grizzly country. The better option is to educate yourself about bears, and move deliberately and be observant. Don't let yourself get lulled into just mindlessly plodding down the trail. Every once and awhile stop and observe your surroundings. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Remember, it's better to heed that ""not right"" feeling and find out the feeling was wrong than to ignore that ""not right"" feeling and find out it was right.

As for snooping around your campsite? Yeah they're gonna do that regardless they are real curious. If you are out long enough a bear WILL come into your camp probably at night and you won't know it. If you don't have anything that interests them they'll nose around a bit then leave. A fun exercise is to clear all the debris from around your shelter, dig up the dirt a bit so it's nice and fluffy, then smooth it out so the dirt is still soft but very even. Then when you wake up you can see the tracks of all the critters that came to say hi. There will be many tracks, mostly rodents, and eventually, yes, bears.

And please remember that in wild nature, energy is precious so by and large the animals are not out to get you because in most places hunting humans is more trouble than it's worth so animals don't do it. Of course you should take precautions -that's why I'm writing this- but don't let caution become paranoia because that can ruin your experience.

Finally, the best piece of advice is that if you see a bear in the wild (and are not attacked) consider yourself lucky. Bears are really really cool animals and vital parts of the ecosystem.",survival

Bring a lighter.,240,ewcnx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ewcnx7/bring_a_lighter/,42,1580448607.0,"First of all I'm no professional. I'm a lurker on here and I see so many posts showing off bug out bags. Firesteels, magnesium starters, a sandwich bag of flint, but very rarely a lighter. All of these alternative starters are just that; alternative. A bic lighter can last several years depending on condition as I will testify from personal experience. A zippo is less likely to be readily usable, but a butane filler can is cheap and has multiple uses.  It goes without saying but having a flame at the flick of your finger is much easier to use under pressure. It also goes without saying that firesteels and such require TONS of practice to use reliably, and even once you get good there's always the environmental factor.

And don't give me that garbage about how you always have a lighter or matches in your pocket/vehicle. Isn't the whole point of this practice to expect the unexpected e.g. not having a lighter in your pocket? It weighs very little and if you carry your bag enough to even end up in a survival situation with it, there's no excuse not to pack a spare bic from the gas station. The few minutes it takes for an experienced survivor to start a fire with a steel could be the difference between life or death.

I was in New Orleans during Katrina. We didn't get flooded. You know what we needed most? Junk food and entertainment. Nothing was open until about a month after the storm, and even then things were limited. Power was out at my place for even longer than that. I read every book in the house, wore out a deck of playing cards, and would have killed for a bag of potato chips. I used to have a picture of the junk food isle from a few years ago when a storm was in the Gulf, and everyone was preparing. It was ravaged. People who have lived through it know better; junk food is right up there in importance with toilet paper. Sure some MRE's have M&M's, but it's just not the same as a giant bag of Zapp's.

Psychological preparedness is often (always?) overlooked. With no power and no job to go to, you might just go a little nuts. Read people's bug out bag/survival gear lists. How many include a small book of Sudoku puzzles or short stories? ""Oh, but you'll be too busy surviving too..."" shut the fuck up and listen to someone who's done it. After a few days, you're accustomed to the fact that the world has turned upside down, you have no idea what's going on and when things will be back to normal (if ever), and that you're powerless to do anything about it. What will you do then? Count your ammunition? Revel over how much toilet paper and dried beans you have piled up in the garage?



tl;dr during Katrina I played a lot of board games because that's what you do when surviving",survival

But even forgetting that, was it really too much to ask for him to give some basic instruction? To allow the poor guy to share his camp at night? To at least MENTION that cold air will settle in the place he's bedding down?

I mean it was just brutal, I was honestly surprised they put it on air. Then, immediately after that the show starts putting out like 1 episode a year.

A few colleagues and I have a new website and are actively writing content.  My name is Martin, and I'm the researcher and writer. I also have two colleagues currently, James, an ex-military person and survival fanatic and Tim, a researcher and outdoor and off-grid expert. 
I started the website on my own back in the summer and knew that I could not get it done by myself with my limited knowledge of all things survival. I have a considerable interest in survival and prepping but let's not kid ourselves, none of us could be called an expert in all factions of survival.

The reason Im here writing this to you is to ask if you have any interest in writing an article on something unique that you would know about in the survival/prepping fields. 
You would be fully credited for writing the article, and a link would also be attached to your website, youtube channel or any other social media account you would like to promote. It's a win-win for all of us, we get conte=nt, and you get exposure. 
Please let me know by private msg if this interest you and we can discuss it further.

I can make a figure four deadfall and the like, and shoot a recurve accurately, for example, but I have only ever trapped anything once, and I have never hunted with my bow.

 To compensate for my lack of experience, I am making some accommadations. For one thing I am growing and bringing in a crop of potatoes. For another I am bringing a fishing pole, which, last time I visited the site I will be living on, I used to catch an absurd amount of bass. That being said, I can't say I'm not nervous. If any of y'all have any general advice to give me I'm all ears, and if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them. Basically, I'm scared so talk to me.

I do have a few specific questions, if anyone has any knowledge they'd like to share:
1. Any thoughts on how I might store potatoes through the winter? I'm concerned that digging a root cellar may be a lot of work, but at the same time I certainly do not want my food source to spoil.
2. Insulating my structure will be a problem. I'm planning on living in a bark wigwam, as that seems like the easiest long term shelter for me to put up, and according to the research I've done, the natives who lived around the NE seem to have done pretty well in them. Critique as necessary.
3. I'm concerned about getting lonely. I'm bringing a dog in. I'll be getting a puppy at the beginning of next week. If any of you see any reason not to, or any more elegant solutions than that, let me know.
4. Considering the pond I'm adjacent to, I could basically get by by just eating fish all day every day (seriously, the first time I went fishing there I took four casts and caught three fish), but I'm concerned about mercury. Is that a legitimate concern?

Edit: Y'all seem pretty anti-puppy. Duly noted. The puppy is out. 
Edit 2: Another common insistence is that I train more before I head in. This is doable. A tentative and flexible schedule:
January-March: A few weekends, one or two extended out to three or four days, spent cold weather camping and practicing bushcraft.
March-June: a few more long weekends, augmented by one week long trip over my break to the site I will be inhabiting. Getting better at hunting, and at constructing liveable shelters. In June I graduate.
July: A week long excursion following the same model as the last. A week spent living indoors and taking hot showers. One more trip, this time two weeks.
August: First week of August spent living at home, making sure I want to do this. After that I do three weeks, come home for a day. If I still want to at that point, I'll go back out semi-permanently.

Does that make sense? It appeals to me because it sorta eases me into the whole thing by increasing time gradually and giving me space to develop skills. I can always extend out the dates if need be.

Edit 3: I really cannot tell you how much I appreciate all the input. Rock on.

Was lucky enough to experience a week in the bush (as the Aussies call it) in South Australia. This course was in preparation for our ""team"" that would be spending the next 2 months in less than desirable conditions in several different locations in Thailand. Most of the week had more of an emphasis on teamwork, confidence building and problem solving than actual survival skills, although they definitely were necessary and came in handy. There were about 12 of us who participated and another 4 people who were team leads. From the get go no information was released not the location, the exact duration or even day and time we would be leaving this was of coarse all planned out to put us on edge and start out with stress levels high it worked. We soon realized every question would be paired with the answer ""you will find out"" usually followed by a smirk. To this day hearing those words drive me crazy. Anyway, we were given a strict packing list of items that were allowed if it wasn't on the list...you went bringing it. period. Were were given a few days to pack and get the items necessary for our adventure. (wish i kept the list so i could post it) but i will do my best to remember it. It was along the lines of 1 jacket, 1 sweater, 1 pair pants, shorts, 2 pair socks, 2 underwear, 1 long sleeve shirt, 1 short sleeve shirt, 1 wool cap/ hat, 1 pair gloves, sleeping bag, sleeping mat/roll, 1 fork/knife, 1 tin cup, 1 tin bowl, 1 utility knife, flashlight, toothbrush. Thats about it and of course they made a list of things we could NOT bring that you might think would make the experience more pleasant which wasn't what was intended. No electronics ie. cell phones, GPS, cameras, watches. lighters, books, food, candy etc. Basically any comforts were not allowed. Before leaving teams were split up and decided by the team leads and of course not many people were happy with the way the teams were chosen (obviously that was the plan). So we moved on and were giving our first surprise, bag drags, to make sure no one was sneaking in any unauthorized items needless to say some of those items were found (and some were not ;) more on that later. For every item that was found the price to pay was push ups. (we did a lot of pushups for some candy and extra socks and an ipod) so moving on. we set off to our unknown destination about 2 hours by bus. It was July in the most southern part of Australia and the summers are opposite from the US so its pretty much mid ""winter"" and yes it does get cold there. The weather is pretty spotty some days its rain and wind very humid and quite cold other days its hot and dry it just depends. So by now its starting to get dark and we are still driving, there are 3 teams in 3 separate vehicles and they turn off on dirt road and we keep driving strait we don't bother asking why because they wont say. we then pull off on  another road and I am randomly selected to be my groups leader (for the meantime) I am taken aside by the team lead and told to listen carefully that i will be verbally given directions once and that is it i will then have to relay those directions to my team in order for use to find our destination. By now it is dark so we have our flashlights out im trying my best to repeat the directions verbatim so there is no miscommunication. We  are then handed our food rations for the week for which we are responsible in dividing and rationing this included 2 live chickens, 1 bag of granola, 1 bag of powdered milk, 6 cans of sardines, 2 sleeve of saltine crackers, and a few cans of beans and canned meat (we did not know what was in the cans though because the labels had been peeled off) just another attempt at humor i guess by adding in another unknown factor. After walking in the dark for about 2 hours we hoped we were headed in the right direction but couldn't be sure since we were not given a timeline or distance. After hitting some key landmarks that were mentioned in the earlier instructions things were looking good. We eventually arrive and are able to relax for a bit until the other 2 teams arrive we were the first ones to get there. After about an hour the other 2 are now arrived (one got a little lost and their attitude showed it) we thought ok now we set up camp and go to sleep. Nope. Ok everyone back on your feet and on to the campsite after given more instructions we head to the next place. About half an hour passes and we get a ""never mind"" go back and set up camp where we just were‚Ä¶ we were not amused. We soon began to realize expect the unexpected. we are then split back up into our teams once we get back to the main checkpoint. Each team is given one large tarp and two 5 ft. pieces of rope we are then left to decide how and where we will set up our shelter for the night. it was only enough tarp to either put under the 4 of us or over us. Luckily the first night was nice no clouds or wind so we laid down on top of it got out our sleeping bags and went to sleep for the 5 short hours we were allowed. Before going to sleep my stomach was already growling from lack of eating and it was only about 6 hours in‚Ä¶ this is going to be a long week i thought. Before you know it we are rudely awakened by loud whistle blowing and yelling and it is still dark. We are given 5 minutes to be packed up and ready to move. For every minute you are late its 10 pushups, a couple people were moving pretty slow and had to push out 50 not how you want to start your morning. We are given 10 minutes for breakfast barely enough time to boil water over a fire so i just at a couple crackers and dry granola. The sun was starting to come up and we got our first brief of the day. We were handed a map compass and a card with directions. As a team we were to find points on a map in proper order, much like the standard SF course finding the 5 points making a star formation. At each point we received another clue and sometimes a small reward (water or fruit) not much but at the time it was amazing. This exercise lasted us about 9 hours and we were the second team to finish. Through out the day we were rotated in and out of leader/follower positions to see if people could do both lead and follow. For food this day it was mainly sardines and crackers whenever we could manage to stop and snack. After this everyone shared what worked what didn't and why. Obviously exhausted we still had to make the fire and set up our camp. This night we were not lucky enough to have a clear sky so we had to use our one shared tarp and draped it between two trees while sleeping on the dirt which quickly became mud. Side note all of the local critters also found shelter under our tarp and large spiders were frequently found in, on and around our sleeping bags and our rucks‚Ä¶im not a fan of spiders, snakes? Sure, don't mind, but spiders F that. After our terrible night of sleep we are again awake before dawn and doing some PT. A quick unsubstantial breakfast and we started on some trust exercises sounds kinda dumb but was actually pretty fun. We did the typical ""trust fall"" type stuff but a little more dangerous. We also did some more communication type exercises like having to be blindfolded in a open field and told where to walk to find a specific point. Sounds easy, it wasn't you couldn't use words to yell to the person where to go. Only sounds were allowed, like a whistle or a clap or foot stomp each noise represented a direction still sounds easy? Each pair, one listener and a leader had to decided what noises meant what movement then they had 4 pairs of people doing it all at the same time. So your blindfolded and all you are hearing is four people clapping grunting and whistling so you have to listen to try and hear your specific leader. Fun but chaotic. For our dinner that day we got to find out what these live chickens we had been lugging around were for. Each group was given a hatchet and with that a quick decapitation and skinning we had a pretty decent dinner. Well, actually it was the most gamy, tough and under weight chicken i had ever eaten but since i was starving it was amazing. That night we thought we were going to set up camp in  the same spot as usual but were instructed to ruck about a mile and ended up at a swap where we were met with a reward. Tents! but of course we didn't just get to pitch hem and go to sleep we had to do it blindfolded luckily I was able to volunteer to do it because im pretty good at setting up a tent. That would be the only night we had tents and it was probably only because of the infestation of insects surrounding the swamp if not for being enclosed we would have been eaten alive by something im sure. Early next day, more PT and no breakfast. We were allowed some free time in the afternoon encouraged to work on small game traps or snares or set up our camp for that night so we wouldn't have to do it in the dark. Every one opted to do that (unfortunately) i say that because after we had spend a few hours setting up our shelter we were told after dinner that we would be sleeping elsewhere and that all that work we did was a waste of time. We were infuriated but pushed along anyway. finally the last day arrived and there was one last event we were split into our four person teams and each team had to decide which person would have a handicap for our 2 mile trek. the handicaps were someone has to have no use of their arms from the shoulder down, one person has no use of one of their legs. One person is blinded cant see. One is mute can say a word and they are the one that knows the destination. Like an arrogant idiot I volunteered to be the one with one leg ""i will just hop or use a stick as a crutch"" I said. Bad idea 100 yards in and I was smoked even without the help of a stick and the ""mute"" it was hard after about 2 hours we finally made it and lesson was learned not to be so quick to do something without thinking it through. If I was thinking clearly I would have made the smallest person the cripple and I would have been the mute and just carried them. I was the biggest so it just didn't work out. Lesson learned. So that was the gist of our trip, I left out quite a few details for time sake and to not be to boring. If you guys have any questions about my experience just ask. Thanks for reading hope you enjoyed. Sorry for the poor writing and grammar not my strong suit.  ",survival

The moderation team has been contacted recently by a few users representing crowd-funding projects requesting permission to post links to their projects. Normally when advertising-only links are posted they are removed outright but in the case of crowd-funding, and having been contacted by the people behind the project for permission, we thought subscribers might be interested in providing feedback to these project. The requesting parties were also informed of [Reddit's stance on self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as a guideline for being allowed to take part in our community.

Since the reception of the most recent post has been less than stellar, we'll defer to you, our subscribers, about whether or not you'd like to see crowdfunding posts.

So, /r/Survival; what'll it be? Yes, No, or Yes but...

Edit: If you'd like to see some, but not all crowd-funding posts, what conditions would you like applied to them?

Please leave your comments *regarding this question* below and the moderation team will take them into consideration for future moderating decisions.

It‚Äôs r/NakedAndAfraidTv. I started it because I used to mod for the original NAA sub but it has become stale. In the past month I was able to line up four very successful AMAs with cast members and I have more lined up. However another mod decided I was ‚Äútoo aggressive‚Äù and took me off the mod list. Therefore I have the new sub which will be much more fun. I‚Äôve had a huge outreach from the sub telling me how I had made it more fun and much better to be on from the AMAs and such and I‚Äôve even seen many positive comments on the AloneTv sub about our AMAs that I had set up recently. So I figured since this sub is full of survivalists, it‚Äôd be the perfect place to find fans of the show or others that could become fans and enjoy the show as well.

"Rant: Why batoning is stupid, Or, How I Learned to Stop Batoning and Love My KaBar",81,4eoc0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/4eoc0h/rant_why_batoning_is_stupid_or_how_i_learned_to/,64,1460618889.0,"I hate batoning with a passion. Not because it can't be done, which it surely can be. And not because it's a bad idea, which it is sometimes and sometimes it's fine. But because the idea has permeated culture, it shows it's effect in knife design, and it shows the ignorance of the user.

Firstly, wood is not just wood. There are multiple varieties of wood in north america, where I live, and many of them have very similar bark patterns. I'm by no means an expert on tree type, but I know the difference between oak, pine, hickory and sycamore. 

Oak is a generally straight grained wood that sometimes has knots in it. A thin piece of oak could be batoned without too much trouble. Pine is well known as a soft material, and I imagine most people that post videos of themselves batoning are going through pine or poplar, as shown by the fact that few of them have trouble. Hickory is a thick, fibrous wood that almost has to be ripped apart in order to be split. A knife can cut some of the fibers when a piece of hickory is laying loose, but batoning through it with a knife is foolish.

Sycamore is another story. I remember striking a piece of sycamore with a 12 lb triangular maul when I was sixteen. Right as he saw me swing, my uncle screamed at me to stop. It was too late. The sycamore was green, something he had just cut. It was full of sap still. That created a suction which locked the log onto the end of the maul, and I mean glued it on there. He spent ten minutes lifting a fifty lb piece of wood on the end of a 12 lb maul up in the air and slamming it into the ground, again and again, trying to just work the maul head loose from the wood. I don't care if Jesus forged that knife for you personally, you're not going to baton through that.

There are special machines made expressly to split wood. Look up gas powered log splitters, splitting mauls, and wedges. All of these are made out of similar metal to the best knives you can buy, and people pay well for them, because they are designed to pull the fibers of wood apart without being broken.

The idea that a knife needs to baton wood in order to be any good has affected knife design. The classic Ka Bar knife has been maligned and broken on youtube multiple times, almost always by batoning. Ka Bar acquired the Becker line to make up for this shortcoming, but most people forget that the Ka Bar was renowned for it's durability in it's day. It competed with other knives that had inferior steel or thin blades designed for fighting, and millions by different manufacturers served in WW2 and came home. Its' stick tang, which is currently considered a weak point in a knife, was the standard for knife making back to the discovery of bronze. 

But today, it's not good enough, cause damnit, I might get attacked by a tree.

The fact is that most people don't use a knife for it's intended purposes, and even those who are intelligent enough to do research on the topic usually get their information from people that know about as much as they do. 

If you look back at the pioneer age, it was unheard of to chop wood with a knife. This was because a knife needed to stay sharp for many reasons. Fleshing out an animal hide had to be done to keep the hide from rotting. A sharp knife would separate the hide closer to the muscle when it first came off, speeding up the process significantly and saving precious meat for food. A sharp knife sliced through the skin of an attacker just as well as a deer, and once inside the body, destroyed organ and vein, accelerating their demise and helping your chances of survival. Full tang knives, while durable, add weight to the equation. Anyone in the military knows why that's a bad thing(hint: you have to walk a whole bunch,) but it also slows down a strike in a defensive situation. A few ounces here or there doesn't seem like much. But it can make a difference of a few fractions of a second in how quickly your arm moves, which is enough to determine whether you have cut a person who hates you, or you are the one cut. Lighter is better sometimes.

This has already gone on longer than I intended it to. Here's a few thoughts to leave you with.



-Would it be harder to baton a hatchet or tomahawk in the same way, and have the advantage of leverage and distance thanks to the handle?

-Do I need to chop all my firewood, or can I collect sticks?

-Is it easier to hack through blocks of wood to get to the good stuff underneath, or carry a little altoids tin with tinder/vasoline in it?

-If I'm dumb enough to put myself in a situation where I have only a knife to keep me alive, am I smart enough to get myself back out of it?

-While toted as safer than using an axe, here is an injury I found while not even looking for batoning injuries; http://imgur.com/a/Aqkai 

In conclusion, I think this fad of hammering knives into helpless trees is pointless, wastes everyone's energy from the user to the knife maker to the person who read about it, and I hope it will end soon. ",survival

It's not just any stick, it's my super secret last resort companion!

Designed with high impact applications in mind, I can use it not just for walking but also poking, hitting, splitting, and much much more!

Materials used:

* 50"" x 1"" Chinese White Wax Wood branch. Purchased it treated, lathed, and finished without taper. I tapered the tip end as I needed.

* Solid brass cane head. When they said solid, they meant it. Shit's like a sword pommel but more shiny.

* 550 Paracord grip. Super cool and sexy! Fixed into place by 1"" pex rings. Patterns used: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_7KMC-Zh54) [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7TDszlZDBA)

* Brass Climbing tip. Not meant for cement (already damaged my sidewalk on accident).

* 3/4"" copper tubing, secured into place by 3/4"" pex rings. Prevents splits and other damage to the business end.

* Everything except the grip is JB welded into place. I didn't weld the grip so I could easily do maintenance on the paracord of the grip. I can tighten it down if it gets too stretched or do a full replacement without having any other piece get in the way.

* Rustoleum painted to protect the wood from serious water damage and to help identify any minor damage, such as scrapes in the the paint.

She's a beast. Ran her through her paces on a couple of nearby trails. The metals didn't really add any noticeable weight so my arm didn't feel exhausted or anything. She also held up better than expected when I defended myself from the torturous monster known only as The Dead Tree Trunk. With a full force swing, the only damage were some scrapes in the paint. I wedged her horizontally into a couple of branches and slowly put my weight on it. She held all 180 lbs. of my fat ass.

Things I'd do differently if I were to make another:

* Get a lathe for tapering. I used dremel to sand everything to shape and that took the most time when building the stick.

* Weave the grip loop into the tension run instead of tying it to it with another piece of cord.

* Square the wood with a planer at the grip to get a tighter pattern on the paracord.

Total cost was under $100 and was worth it just for the fun of making it.",survival

Hours: 72 (A few more of less with traveling)
Locale: Forest, Lakes, Streams, River
Packed: 2 Flashlights (3D Maglite, and AA Maglite), Wound Sealing / Blood Stopping Powder, Toilet Paper, Lighter, Matches, Striker, Steel Wool with 9V Battery, Battery backups (2 AA, 3 D, 1 9V), Empty Bottles (3 gallon bottle, 1 gallon, 2 20oz), Kabar, Smaller generic knife, Rain Jackets / Pants, Boots, Bandages / Alchohol, Cell Phone, Tent, Backpack, Paracord - 7 Strand, A pot, a pan, fishing hooks)

We drove 80 miles to reach this destination. When we arrived, immediately we pulled our packs out of the truck and hiked about a mile to our planned camp spot. We had never done this before, so we decided to discuss what we were going to do while we put up the tent - We chose not to plan ahead on purpose.

Our first choice was water - which only left us the lake as far as we knew, and then food, and then fire. From our tent, I pulled a cord along the side and tied a rock to it - Which created a curvature from the top - I then put the 3 gallon water below it which would catch water in case it rained (This almost felt silly since the skies were so clear, but I tossed that feeling because I knew it had to be covered just in case). We then set off with the two 20oz bottles to the lake. It was really filthy - Mind you, this is 2 hours into setting up camp so we were already feeling the need for water after all of the work we've put into things so far - However we chose to build a fire first in place of getting water, so we could get charcoal for a makeshift filter that we planned out at the same moment. On the way back to camp we came across some dirt/sandy substance which we put in our pockets to add to the filter as well. So we returned to camp.

Time, 3.5 hours. Sun beaming down - Approx 1PM.

We didn't eat before coming out here. We were getting hungry.
Beginning work on the fire (of which we have never done before in this context) we soon learned it is far more difficult (at first) than it had seemed. It took an hour to get the fire going - We switched out 3 or 4 times using the striker as we became pretty fatigued leaning over the kindle, getting an ember, and then moving in and out of that small area trying to give it air and then go in for a slight blow. It was not working. We switched to the lighter - and laughed in a fatigued almost dehydrated kind of wary laughter- because we knew we may have needed that lighter and there it was, saving our asses. We treated that fire like it was a king, delicately placing small debris of forest materials around it, teasing it to get bigger. Eventually it did. And that process taught us so much - And our future fires a lit much faster because of it. It seems that experience really is everything sometimes. The fire grew, and we had charcoal. Sadly with out motives we had to put it out since we were on our way to the water.. we tried out best to pad it with dirt in hopes that it would stay warm - So the embers have an easier time lighting up when we return.

5 Hours - We feel like we haven't accomplished much of anything at this point. But we kept pushing.

The first attempt at a filter, was decent but not good enough. We placed layers of sand and charcoal in the bottle, and lined the opening with toilet paper to let the water leak through in drops. The bottom was cut off, and that's where we poured the water from the lake. We used the other bottle to collect the water.

It was filtering extremely slow - But the water was so delicious in the few drops that it was. However we realized that we couldn't spend all day out here filtering this. We returned to camp, grabbed the 3 gallon jug and shlopped the water from the lake into it and boiled it. We boiled it on the fire by using many sticks to create a type of table over the fire. After having water to drink we were ready to get some food. We headed back to the lake, but not before I used a bit of the water from the pot to clean out the 3 gallon jug and return it to it's spot on the tent to hopefully collect water.

Created makeshift fishing poles with sturdy sticks we picked up on the way, on the end we used the paracord as line. We soon realized after about 30 minutes of attempting to catch fish - That we needed to modify the line, as it was a bit to thick. So we pulled out 1-2 strands and used those on the hooks. We then caught 2 fish over 1.5 hours. With the sun beaming down, and again dehydrated, we returned to camp to eat.

The fish was unlike anything I've ever tasted. It was almost as if I had never eaten anything real in my entire life - And it was because of my physical state. I devoured my portion of the fish, adding some greens from the area to cushion my stomach a bit more - As the fish really wasn't that much.

It was getting late (not sure if my time estimations are correct here). We were fatigued, but our mental state was still steady. We knew the next day may not end as steady as this one, so we discussed what we would do in the morning, and how we'd survive for another two days.",survival

Maybe it's just because I've been working 10-16 hr days for the last 4 years, but I am totally miserable, and none of it is worth it. Not a damn thing I can buy with money makes it worth doing something I don't want to do, and I'm not good enough to make money doing things I like. Even if I was or could be, my lack of self confidence would never let me try.
I basically went AWOL for a few days on a camping trip alone in a one man tent, and it was the best I've felt in a long time. If anyone knows a warm, bountiful place to live where money isn't required, or maybe even communities of people just living off the land in tents, I would appreciate the knowledge. Otherwise I'm most likely going to kill myself within 3 to 5 years. I tell myself I could never do that to my mom, but I know deep down that if I can't find a better way to live where I don't hate 80% of the time I am conscious, I'm going to quit.

Upon arriving, I searched around for a while, trying to find a thread that appropriately satisfied my question. None did. SO, without further adieu, here is my question:

 **WHAT IS THE BEST SURVIVAL KNIFE?**

Now hold on! Before you leave, just give me a chance! Whenever I see a forum with this question, it always turns into a battle of loyalty to some company. Regularly, I would just get on Amazon and find a knife with great reviews, but I had a talk with a really neat guy yesterday who got me thinking. While I have a limited understanding of his past, I can tell you this: I do not envy the man who's job is to attack/assassinate/stalk him. He really gave me some words of wisdom. On the subject of pistols, he said ""Now, if you can find a cheap gun out there that works for you, great! More money in your pocket! But before *I* buy anything, I ask myself;

*Would I bet my life on this?*

And if the answer is *no*, then I save up for the item I had in mind.""
I now would be loathe to buy a knife without hearing some great things about it. So, R/Survival, what knife is:

Versatile, strong, adequately proportioned (just the right size), and above all else, **RELIABLE**?

Thanks, and sorry for the wall of text!

Or they are people who find it difficult to fit into society due to their predicament, i.e. lack of relevant skills in the current job market or just plain bad luck.  They are helpless to prepare for the complex future and find comfort in the return to simple ways, to basic survival where they have a chance to start anew.

8 Tips to drive through Waterlogged Roads,4,4v5ux5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/4v5ux5/8_tips_to_drive_through_waterlogged_roads/,5,1469814708.0,"Monsoons aren‚Äôt as friendly as we want them to be and with potholes, flooding, poor visibility, waterlogged roads, it isn‚Äôt a pretty sight either. Not all drive big SUV‚Äôs that can calmly pass through a waterlogged road, that‚Äôs why it is important that you be very careful while driving on such road you take utmost care to avoid stalling your vehicle and getting stuck in the middle of the road.

A little preparation and presence of mind can get you out of a tricky situation without harming you or your vehicle. We give you 8 tips to drive through waterlogged roads that will come in handy.

**1. Avoid Speeding**

It will be fun to speed through waterlogged roads and puddles splashing water everywhere; but in actuality speeding will do more harm to your vehicle. Water logging hides out any potholes, open drainages on the road and you end up speeding yourself right into one of them. You don‚Äôt have much control on your vehicle while speeding, which is dangerous not only for you, but also for the other cars, pedestrians and so on, since there is minimal stopping power into play.

**2. Stay In The Centre Lane**

If you do have to drive through a waterlogged road, it would be a good idea to stick to the centre lane on the road. The depth of water is higher on the left side and it would be a good idea to stick to the centre lane and maintain an optimum speed on your vehicle. Roads are designed with a tilt to the left side for the rain water to collect and flow into the drainage. The water depth should be at level in the centre lane and will help you judge better, if it is possible to drive through it or not.

**3. Avoid If Water Level Is Above The Exhaust**

Judge the depth of water before you venture on the waterlogged road. If the water level is rising above your door sills, it‚Äôs best to avoid driving. Your exhaust will be completely submerged in water and there is a dry chance that it will enter your engine severely damaging several components. Moreover, certain insurance companies may not process your claim of driving on waterlogged roads, and you will have to end up paying for the very expensive damages out of your pocket.

**4. Keep The Throttle Pressed**

In the event that you do have to drive through a waterlogged street, it is important that you keep the throttle pressed at all times. Maintain a constant speed, you don‚Äôt need to floor the throttle, just keep it gently pressed. Even if you need to change gears, make sure you do that with keeping the throttle pressed. It is best to drive in the first and the second gear at the most and maintain a consistent speed, with higher revs. The idea is to keep the water out of the engine, which could enter from the exhaust pipe.

**5. Avoid Starting Your Car**

In any case, if the vehicle does stall amidst the water do not try restarting the engine. Your vehicle could go into something known as hydrostatic lock causing the engine to seize. Cranking the engine will allow more water seep in and cause extensive damages. Also do not open the bonnet while the car is stuck in an effort to start the car, you will only be making way for more water to get through. It is best that you ask someone to tow your car away from the road, or wait it out till the water level recedes.

**6. Make Way For Others**

This may seem a little harsh, but it is best to follow another car on waterlogged roads. This will keep you informed well in advance in case the car in front does land up with some problem. If there is a car coming from the opposite direction, it is better to wait for it to pass by and then move forward. The ripples created by that car, could unnecessarily add to your problems. Make sure that you let other cars the right of way first, especially at crossings. With the visibility low, you don‚Äôt want any mishaps added to your agony.

**7. Take An Alternate Route**

During monsoons, it is better to lookout for alternate routes that are likely to be less flooded. Even though they could be the busiest, since everybody will be using it, you will save a lot of money that would inadvertently go into the repairing the car. It is better that you plan your route well in advance and also keep a tab on the weather. Even though you cannot always let the weather control your travel plans, you can fairly decide if it is better to use public transport or take your vehicle out.

**8. Take A Break**

It is best to stop and take a break while it‚Äôs raining. If it‚Äôs flooding, it is better to stay at home. Not only will you be safe, but won‚Äôt spend countless hours in traffic jams risking your life and money. If the trip is not important, it is best to avoid it. You can choose to wait till it stops raining and then commence your journey. Above everything else, stay calm. You tend to think better when calm and will be able to use your presence of mind to wade in deep waters more effectively.

Driving through rains can be a stressing task for you and your car. That said, it is best that you prepare your car for the monsoons with a pre-monsoon check. Most manufacturers come up with pre-monsoon check service camp that will prepare your car for the monsoons. You can also refer to our comprehensive guide on how to prepare your car for the monsoons",survival

1) How can I get food without money (basically how can I hunt legally and not have problems with DNR/Law enforcement) such as is an unstrung recurve bow/slingshot legal to carry with me?

2) Where is the safest place to set up camp for the night? I don't want to just set up camp in someones forest because of chances of being caught/shot (some redneck southerners don't fuck around)

3) best/safest route to take (remember I'd like to start further south hitting the Appalachian trail if possible)

Here I will be filming myself on my way towards the coordinates that you pick for me to provide you with a genuine adventure and a way to see my progress towards becoming a proficient outdoorsman and all-round adventurer. All the adventures will take place in the Norwegian wilderness.

I decided to start this channel to gauge my skills and improve them but I also hope to inspire others to work towards their dreams, because I know there are many others out there like me that want to attain the skills to live their dreams, but that don‚Äôt see a clear path towards realising this. A gap that becomes especially apparent when comparing oneself with inspirational figures that are already living this dream. 

My full introduction is now online and you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-jFqCNUZU)

You can also follow me on Twitter where I‚Äôll post sneak peak pictures of the next episode, which will come out exactly one week from now. You can find my account [here](https://twitter.com/CoordChallenge)
 
After the first episode has come out I will start posting new episodes bi-weekly.

I hope that everyone will be so kind to help me make this a success and that you‚Äôll tune in even if you‚Äôre not too keen on hiking, if only for the health benefits of watching nature. 

For now I will be looking forwards to the places you will be sending me to!

Safe travels and an adventurous new year!

Not to mention you can take out some of the fuel soaked cotton and use it as kindling if everything is really wet, and the best part about a zippo is that it's windproof. Also, they're extremely durable, and even if they do break, they're easily fixable because everything comes apart and fits together again.  Also, if the fuel in your bic gets cold in the winter, the flame will be tiny. I'm sure a few of you have old zippos lying around that don't work nearly as well as people say, but try this. Pull out and trim the wick. Put in a new flint. Squeeze out the remaining fuel and refill it. Your zippo will light the first time you flick it. And the second, and it will probably be a good few days to a week before you even need to flick the wheel twice to light it. 

I just don't see why bics are the go to lighter. In my opinion you should carry some bics as a backup, but a zippo should be your primary. It is the AK-47 of lighters. The Ka-Bar USMC. The Gibson Les Paul. They are absolutely worth the little extra price.",survival

* Building shelters for small and large groups
* Foraging
* Advanced fire building and managing different types of fires (cooking vs warmth, etc)
* Essential tools, assembling a quality kit on a budget and maybe some basic tool maintenance
* Orienteering and navigation
* Basic First Aid

Supplies: Hunting Knife, Rifle (.308), Warm Clothes

Scenerio: You've lost the trail, and it is close to dark.

Additional Scenerio Details: You've brought matches but they are wet, and your flashlight is dead.

Immediate Needs: Shelter, Fire.

Eventual Needs: Water, Food

Goals: Be found or get back to town

**EDIT: Well, I survived. I spent one night on State land about a half-mile from my vehicle. I managed to construct a lean-to shelter, cleared out the snow on the ground, laying down branches of pine to create a layer between me and the ground. Then, I layered more pine branches over the lean-to due to rain and snow over the weekend. Average day temp was 27 degrees f, night temp got down to roughly 0. I DID have to break into my secondary survival bag, but I only used the magnesium fire starter, leaving everything else unused. For firewood, I started with birch bark (natures tinder) and moved to pine branches, then spruce limbs (still relatively wet). I placed larger logs on the opposite side of the fire from me to direct heat towards the shelter and myself. I was lucky enough to construct the lean-to between two landmasses that blocked most of the wind chill during the night. It was certainly uncomfortable but survivable. I may have used my phone to browse Reddit at one point :P**",survival

Stranded - Surviving on Human Milk?,3,4gamlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/4gamlt/stranded_surviving_on_human_milk/,5,1461569314.0,"A rather oddball question, hear me out.

I was reading a news article about a New Zealand women finding herself stranded for a few days in the middle of nowhere. To sustain herself, amongst other things, she decided to benefit from her body's milk as she was lactating. Article can be found here:

http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-lost-new-zealand-woman-survives-on-breast-milk-2015-5/?r=AU&IR=T

Personal preferences aside, from a purely curious, investigative and scientific point of view, this seemed like an ingenious idea. Given the high nutritional properties of such milk, it serves as a whole food for infants and given the situation this lady was in, it potentially could serve as a very beneficial substance for the adult human. It got me thinking, given the remarkable anatomy of the human being, could an (almost) self sustaining cycle of milk production-consumption keep a person from suffering greatly in such dire circumstances?

Like Mythbusters, I started investigating. The milk contains high values of a lot of nutrition an adult human requires bar a shortage of a few vitamins, etc. It is high in calories and it sustains human life in its early stages. To be expected, it turns out this 'superfood' is very caloric and energy intensive to produce. It also requires the body to be generously hydrated to allow the process of lactation to continue unhindered.

There are two main points I came across to sustain a constant supply:

    Body must receive enough calories (nutrition)
    Body must be sufficiently hydrated

Now for the scenario. You are in your land cruiser travelling deep outback and up in mountainous-muddy-unstable terrain. You have packed with you essential camping supplies, food, water and also many cartons of Mass Gainer, Protein Powder and Supplements. Unfortunately, despite your best preparations, your car breaks down/gets stuck/is rendered immobile in a part of country with no one around and no cell/Internet/radio reception. You are however, a fresh new-mother with your body's lactation kicked into high gear.

You are stuck and awaiting rescue. You expect the worse, to be stranded for months on end. You begin to ration your supplies and come to realise you have solid food and water for only a few weeks. You, being the strong brave women, decide to pro-actively think of ways to sustain yourself. Your hunting skills aren't enough to get you by and you see no lake to fish. You remember your pre-pregnancy coaching and life-skills advice. All those videos and articles you immersed yourself in have taught you something crucial; your milk is a precious life supply. Combining this with your knowledge of science and your gym supplies which you were going to sell, you hatch a plan to effectively live off your own milk.

To achieve a constant and healthy supply of milk, you will address the two main limiting factors which were drilled into you in the nine most happy and hormonally unstable months of your life:

    Calorie Surplus ‚Äì You utilise your 1000 calorie/serve mass gainer to keep your body in a 5000 calorie surplus daily
    Hydration & Satiation ‚Äì You decide to drink the few litres of milk you produce to keep yourself hydrated and full for the time you are stranded.
    a You have a positive attitude and trust your body to support you. You utilise the vitamin and mineral supplements to keep your body well balanced (nutritionally and emotionally speaking).

Note here that the mass gainer is a powered substance with some nutritional value. It is largely a combination of carbohydrates, fats and protein with a mix of a few proprietary compounds to give the product an edge (extra vitamins, minerals, other nutrients). It is not something to live off of as it is not considered whole food. Further if this was to be considered, the person would be unable to satiate and hydrate themselves from the powder alone thus leading to lethargy and possible ailments.

The idea is to provide the necessary 'tools' for the body to keep producing this valuable 'superfood' which contains (almost) all the necessary nutrients, hydration and satiation required to live off of.

We are assuming, since you are a new mother that you have a pumping method sorted out and can achieve a constant output with minimal hassle.

You have enough gym supplies to keep yourself going for many months. You decide to settle in and make yourself comfortable to avoid anxiety. You are at ease knowing that your family will send help. You end up being stranded for twelve months (1 year).

You see your baby now a year old. You are overjoyed to be reunited with your family.

Again I am emphasising to please keep your personal feelings aside. Please do not compare this to drinking your own urine or something of the sorts.

What do you think, is it sustainable to live off of (almost) entirely your own milk? Would supply be hindered, how? In a more practical scenario, if you were to be stranded in a place so remote that it took a year for search and rescue to find, probably you would have went with a partner (say your husband). Say in this case, would the husband be able to live entirely off your milk supply for an entire year (plus vitamin/mineral supplements)? Of course you may have to double your caloric intake. Your body would also adapt to the increased demand so your supply should be plentiful.

Thank you everyone for reading this long post. All curious minds, scientists, philanthropists alike, what do you think?

To give you an idea, we plan on bringing food/water but we would really like to catch our own food and drink from the natural water resources as much as possible. We will bring a tent, but if the weather holds we would ideally like to build our own debris huts to live in. Essentially we want to build our skills such that we are eventually able to truly survive if we were to find our selves stuck out in the bush with nothing but a small backpack of essentials.

* 3 hours without shelter

* 3 days without water

* 3 weeks without food

I am a leader from my local scouts group (age 15 -  20) One of our new events is a primitive camp for a few days. (We have storebought food and plenty of drinking water available) 

The point of the camp is going back to basic, with a little bit of survival. Sleep in a primitive tent, cook above a camp fire. No elektronics. You get the idea. 

Now the past 2 camps we (the leaders) learned them about maming fire(chopping trees, cutting firewook, make a tinder) making fire with 1 match, making fire without matches and some basic edible plants (mint, carrot, potato cellery) 

Now the idea is to make it every time a little bit harder, more tougher. 

Can you give me some ideas about basic survival wich i can learn these kids? My own ideas were tapping trees, and extracting oil from bark. But im running out of ideas, and its hard for me to know what will be doable and what not, for i have to learn the skill myself and be able to teach it.

I wanted to get your opinion on this.  I know the original design was kinda flawed and considered a pretty bad knife but what about the pro edition?  It seems to have addressed a lot of those original concerns and for the price ~$60 seems to be a pretty good value with all the stuff that it comes with.

I'm looking for an all around useful knife that is flexible enough to be used for multiple purposes and variety of situations while being very durable, low maintenance or at least easily field serviced.  It'll most likely be used for some wood (batoning and prepping wood tools or fire making) and ropes work and possibly some prying with a bit of food prep as well.  I don't expect to use the knife to hammer much but I figure its a useful feature in case things ever go really south and thats all you have.

One thing I kind of like about the BGUSKP and the Gerber LMF 2 is the possibility of turning it into a spear easily.  I've never actually done this, so is it difficult with a knife like the ka-bar bk2 or esee 4?

* Use for survival/hunting situations to conserve ammo, stay silent, while giving yourself a solid shoulder-stabilized platform to fire from for increased accuracy

 I'm creating a technique called ""Planet Code"". 

Basically you can carry a red sheet about 3x3 meters. If you are in trouble, you can find an empty place without shadows, and lay it out. Place stones at the corners to avoid wind. Ideally this will be captured by a satellite in 24 hours and we can get this signal. You can also use that sheet at night to capture water drops from plants and morning fog.

If you don‚Äôt have that sheet, you can use materials on site ( leaves, stones, anything that stands out from the background) to form a certain pattern. And the satellites will catch it and recognize it. 

This technique can be use in the wilderness, desert, lonely islands, snowy mountains, etc. 

I‚Äôm thinking about teaching a training course by email. The cost will be $20 for materials, and $15 for the red sheet (includes shipping). 

Anyone interested? Please follow and tell me where you are located. California will be the place for the first class. A certificate will be provided if passed. 


Cheers,

I ended up ordering 4 different models for around only 60 bucks. They are definitely low cost and come razor sharp from the factory. I wanted to ask a few questions to the people that brought these knives to my attention.



1. How well do their stainless steel models resist rust being submerged or in a wet environment without getting oiled? I bought the stainless model specifically for canoe/fishing trips. The last time I went I brought along a Buck 119 that resisted rust very well. It was submerged for long periods of time and had zero special care given to it. 

2. Is regular gun oil good enough to keep the carbon steel blades from rusting?

3.Is there a website that I can view the different tang types of  specific different models? Like an X-ray view?

4. Does anyone here carry a Mora as their only fixed blade knife in their kit? They seem make great back up blades but I'm just not sure how long they would hold up as a main tool option. 

5. How do you get a nice edge on the spine of the blade to throw sparks with a ferro rod? Just flatten it with a file? Will the stainless model throw sparks as well as the carbon versions?

6. What is a good way to add some grip to the handle of the classic no.1? I like how light the knife is but without any hilt I can't help but see myself slipping and cutting the hell out of my finger.


I think that's pretty much all I had to ask about so far. Thanks in advance for any help you guys can give me.

To Wool or not To Wool,1,3yhkzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/3yhkzv/to_wool_or_not_to_wool/,16,1451309506.0,"Okay, so, recently, someone questioned the idea that wool keeps you warm when wet and linked to an article where the author claimed to do a scientific test of the insulative value of wool when wet, linked [here](http://woodtrekker.blogspot.ca/2012/03/does-wool-keep-you-warm-when-wet.html).

The problem here is that his experiment is heavily flawed.

He does not say how he measures temperature, but I doubt he had a device remote-monitoring the temperature. Removing the insulation and opening the container to test the temperature will skew the results. This alone makes his test unreliable.

Another problem is that this isn't testing something that continuously produces heat and checking to see how long it takes for heat to transfer through the barrier. The longer it takes, the better the insulative value. This, again, makes his test unreliable.

The final nail in the coffin, however, is what he did with the wool, attempting to simulate a heavy downpour. By continuously adding room temperature water, he was not only keeping the wool saturated, but stripping heat away from the entire wool object. Rain will only strip away heat in the small area that it hits, not the whole garment. Given that we are taller than we are wide, only a small area of your garment will be getting heat stripped away at a time. The rest will continue to insulate in all but the absolute worst downpours.

What this guy tested is more in line with testing the insulative value while you're currently stuck under water. In that case, the results make perfect sense; if you have cold water continuously stripping aware the thermal mass of the little gaps in your clothes that give you insulation, they will not provide any insulation.

This is bad science and does not give us any information what-so-ever about the insulative value of wet wool. No one claims that wool maintains all of its insulative value when wet, only that it maintains most, which is better than none. The only thing concludable from his experiment is that being wet is worse than being dry; nothing else.

These [shameless nerds](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-does-wet-wool-insulate-while-wet-cotton-does-not-insulate.270141/) explain the physics behind wool and fleece maintaining insulative value when wet; which despite this flawed experiment, they do.

Is being dry preferable to be wet? Certainly. But, if there's a possibility that you will get wet, is it preferable to be wet without layers, wet in cotton layers, or wet in wool or fleece layers? The answer is obvious.",survival

37 survival tips and tricks for the wilderness [my list],5,3hjr9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/3hjr9z/37_survival_tips_and_tricks_for_the_wilderness_my/,4,1439991235.0,"When it comes to survival, the more you know, the better. While you can't possibly prepare for every single thing that is out there, you can try your best to be as aware of many of them as you can. Sometimes these bits and pieces of knowledge can seem quite like useless trivia at times, but don't be fooled. The knowledge is there not to be useful ALL the time, but rather to be there when you need it the most. That is why I put together a massive list of 50 Survival Tips and Tricks for the wilderness.

1. Create a thick fire signal. A combination of fresh pine and spruce leaves produce a lot of smoke, which is what you want with the signal. Start out by building a small fire using dry leaves, twigs, or other tinder. Collect the fresh pine and spruce leaves and compile them into a bow. When the fire is up and smoking, put the leaves over the fire, making sure to cover it completely. This will cause the branches to burn intensely, producing even more smoke.

2. Staying Cool in the Desert. This may not be the best-smelling solution to preventing heatstroke when you're out in the scorching desert, but it works. Take a piece of cloth like a bandana and soak it in urine. Wrap it around your head and it will keep your head from feeling the wrath of the sun. Heat stroke is the second leading cause of death in the desert, next to dehydration.

3. Learn to tell where North is without navigational survival gear! If you need the help of a compass but you don't have one, you can use an analog watch to do that. Point the hour (long) hand at the sun and draw two imaginary lines between it and the 12 o'clock point. You will create an angle between the two lines. Draw an imaginary straight line bisecting the angle. The line point away from the sun is north, because the sun always goes to set in the south direction.

4. What if you don't have a watch? Don't worry. As long as you know what time it is, you can still tell where north is. Simply draw an analog representation of the time on the ground and draw the lines from there. Cellphones are particularly useful in telling the actual time regardless where you are because mobile tech nowadays uses GPS to be able to tell the time of the day regardless of location. Of course, it's always advised that a survivalist have a watch with them at all times.

5. Always have char cloth ready. Take any small piece of cloth and place it inside a metal container. Make sure that the container has a cover. Burn the container (with the cloth inside it) for a couple of minutes. You know you're doing it right if the cloth remains intact but is dark from all the burning. Char cloth is really great for starting fires because it catches fire with just a small spark. Tip: Try cutting or ripping a large cloth into really small pieces and neatly roll them inside a tuna can. You'll have yourself an entire pack of char cloth!

6. Use hand sanitizer from your survival kit to start embers. Hand sanitizers may look like they‚Äôre only useful for cleaning your hands, but they‚Äôre also good for starting fires. This is because they contain alcohol, which is flammable. Simply use some of the stuff on a char cloth or some leaves or other tinder and they‚Äôll easily catch fire from a spark. So always keep a small bottle in your pocket.

7. Shave off that fat wood! The resins from pine trees are very useful if you reduce them into tiny shavings. They easily catch fire and can therefore be used as an easy to find ingredient to starting fires because the can be found practically everywhere. But what makes them special is that the smoke that's produced from burning the shaved fat wood makes effective mosquito repellents.

8. Learn basic body insulation. This is a life saver in many situations where you're caught in really cold weather and you've got no means of starting a fire. Simply stuff newspaper, dry grass, and leaves under your clothes and you'll be retaining significant amounts of body heat when you need it the most. You can do this to almost all of your clothing, from head to toe.

9. Get water from trees. This works on any tree, but it works better with those with leaves that are directly exposed to the sun. Wrap a plastic bag around the leaves. When the sun forces the water inside the leaves to evaporate, the water will be trapped inside the plastic bag and settle into the plastic bag. With proper positioning, the water will be trapped in a way that you can simple poke a hole through the bag so that the water flows through. You can then keep the water in a container. Note: Make sure your plastic bags are clean.

10. Use toothpaste to relieve bug bites. This is a well-known home remedy for burns and some wounds, but few people know that their tooth paste can help treat bug bites as well. This is because they have properties that will help sooth any itchiness or pain that most bug bites cause. They will also help reduce any swelling that might result from the bites.

11. Put tampons on your survival first aid kit! Tampons are very effective in dealing with deep wounds because they were designed to absorb lots of moisture. They also gradually take the shape of the wound as they swell over time. You can bring lots of them because they're small, lightweight, can be bought almost anywhere, and are pretty inexpensive.

12. Keep that used up lighter. If your Zippos or flintlock lighters have run out, keep them because you can still use it to make fire. There's usually cotton inside these types of lighters. Take them out and use the flint to create a spark. The cotton is usually so dry it will catch fire easily. Alternatively, you can keep using the lighter to create sparks that could help you start a fire with other types of tinder like char cloth.
Here's a video about how to make a fire using aluminum foil

13. Have aluminium foil handy. While you'll always have this in your survival food kits to store your food, keep a separate sheet in your bag to always have a dry surface. This can come in handy as a dry surface to start fires on, especially when it just rained and the soil is too damp for you to be able to start a fire. Use this with your char cloth and other tinder you have with you and you'll be able to start a campfire even when it's wet outside.

Aluminium foil can also be used as a makeshift bowl. Simply place a rock on top of the foil and wrap around, using the rock as a mould. Tin foil can also be used as a reflector around a camp fire to maximize the heat. The uses of aluminium foil are endless.

14. Reduce excessive light with masking tape. Having too much light from your flashlight could be dangerous at night depending on your situation. Placing a masking tape over the light will lessen the amount of light enough to give you a low profile while giving you enough to be able to work with.

15. Always know how to find the North Star. The North Star always points to true north, which is great for when you don't have a compass at night or when you want to check the accuracy of the compass you have. Try looking for the big dipper first, which is easy to find if you know your constellations. Then draw an imaginary straight line through the edges of the big dipper and this will lead you to the tail of the little dipper. This is the North Star.

16. Consider a guitar case as your choice of survival bag. This is a rather unusual but very useful alternative to the typical bug out pack. The shape of the bag will allow you to store an unbelievable large amount of things. Plus, it's very inconspicuous, especially when a hiker's or camper's backpack is often the easiest way to spot a person who isn't from around the area, which can have its disadvantages. It's a good way to pack lots of stuff without sticking out in public.

17. Keep those carbon steel parts! The carbon sheets that you can get from saws have been proven to be able to withstand 22 calibre pistol bullets. With just a bit of duct tape and some proper attachment, you can create armour around your backpack and clothes that will protect you from shrapnel, arrows, and certain types of bullets. They're bendable, snap proof, and stainless steel.

18. Grill survival food with metal picks. You will most likely have long, thin, metal rods or picks (used for tents) among your equipment. You can use this to form a makeshift grill but laying them across two logs. Use twigs and strings to keep them intact when necessary. Set this up over a fire and you can grill fish over the picks. You can use an aluminium cup to boil water over this setup as well.

19. Rocks around the campfire are very useful. Even after the fire had died, the rocks will still hold on to enough heat to keep you warm. The heat of the rock can also be used to purify water. Simply place them inside aluminium cans filled with water. It will cause the water to boil, purifying it enough to be safe to drink.

20. Improve the taste of water with simple survival techniques. The water from swamps, even after they've been purified, can still smell really dodgy. To remedy this, add some charcoal to the water while it's being boiled. Not only does this add to the purification process, but it also makes the water taste much more ""drinkable."" It also takes away that bad smell.

21. Always wear a survival bracelet. More popularly known as paracord bracelets (because they're made from the same material as military issued parachutes and equipment), these bands are more than just accessories. They're actually cords that are woven together, which you can unravel and use partly whenever you need the cords to tie stuff up. Almost every single piece of the paracord bracelet is usable string - right to the small threads that are used to keep the end of the cords together. Use them to tie stuff, hang food, set up traps, and even as tinder to start fires.

22. Add aluminium sheets to your survival shelters. The aluminium blankets or sheets added to your shelter will significantly increase your shelter's heat retention capacity. Aluminium facing outward of the shelter can also reflect sunlight, allowing you to stay cooler under the shelter. Among the survivalist community, these are referred to as ""super shelters,"" and rightfully so.
Here's a video about using glow sticks for survival

23. Carry glow sticks with you! These aren't just for rave parties. Glow sticks make it easy for you to be spotted at night (i.e. by rescue groups). When needed, activate one of the sticks and tie them with a paracord outside your backpack, allowing it to hang freely. You will be very easy to spot even in pitch black darkness with these glow sticks.
Check this out: Top 10 uses for a survival poncho

24. Bring a poncho. These seemingly simple disposable raincoats actually have so many uses in the outdoors. Obviously, it's best used as a raincoat, but here are some other things you can do:
     ‚Ä¢ Use it as a makeshift shelter. It's big enough to fit one person.
     ‚Ä¢ Use it to desalinate seawater. Just boil seawater underneath a tented poncho to catch the vapour and produce the           water through condensation. This will separate the salt from the water, making it drinkable.
     ‚Ä¢ Use it to collect rainwater.

25. DO NOT use unclean water to wash wounds. While this sounds like common sense, a lot of people will make the mistake of using water in rivers to clean their wounds without treating them first. Bodies of water, as clear as they may seem, will have bacteria from all sorts of matter, including animal faeces. If your hand has any cuts or lacerations, don't ever dip them into the water.
Here's a video about how to use water purification tablets

26. Always carry with your water purifying tablets. You can't always depend on a fire source to be able to boil water, such as when it gets rainy and the ground and everything else is too damp to ignite. Also, you can't always start a fire when you're injured. In these instances, it's better to pop a tablet into a container so you get the much needed water instantly.

27. Know what to do with animal entrails and faeces. When it comes to stuff that animals leave behind, make sure you don‚Äôt dispose of the ones that you can use as fishing bait, repellents, etc. Some of these include:
     ‚Ä¢ Using bones to make tools/weapons
     ‚Ä¢ Using urine of female dead animals to attract other animals for food
     ‚Ä¢ Using pelts and skins to make small pouches, etc.
Don‚Äôt just throw these things away. Figure out if there‚Äôs some way you can re-purpose the excess parts after you capture your game.

28. Process food away from the camp. Remember that when you process food you catch (i.e. trapped animals or caught fish); you‚Äôre likely to leave stuff behind such as blood, bones, inedible parts, etc. If you process your food near you‚Äôre going to attract wild animals. They‚Äôll be sniffing around the camp and around you, which could be dangerous. The same survival tips apply to disposing food remains.

29. Save energy on chopping wood. Don‚Äôt bother using an axe. Just place the wood pieces diagonally between the ground and a tree. Give the pieces of wood a good kick and you‚Äôll be able to snap them in half. Using other tools will only waste your time. You‚Äôll be using these as firewood, so they don‚Äôt need to be perfect when chopped. Of course, this doesn‚Äôt apply to the wood materials to be made into shelters.

30. Sleep on elevated surfaces. Sleeping on the ground will cause you to lose body heat faster, making it more likely for you to get cold. Sleeping on a poncho or a really thin blanket isn‚Äôt going to help this either. The best way to do this is to stack up leaves or logs to make a padded bed. Alternatively, you can bring a hammock with you and just set it up when you sleep.
here's a video about How to organize your bug out bag or your survival pack

31. Organize your survival pack efficiently. When arranging the stuff in your rucksack, follow these principles:
     ‚Ä¢ Heavier stuff should be on top and the lighter ones at the bottom. This will help maintain your balance.
     ‚Ä¢ Make sure the backpack is positioned to be on your upper back always. This will allow you to walk freely without your rucksack getting in the way of your legs.
     ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt forget to tighten those straps to prevent stuff from falling off. The wilderness can be full of snags, thanks to branches and bushes.

32. Minimize layers. Campers often think that you have to bundle up all the time to protect yourself from the cold. But if you cover up too much even when you don‚Äôt need to, you‚Äôre likely to sweat inside, which minimizes insulation. As long as you‚Äôve got your extremities (i.e. hands, feet, and head) covered, you can go about in cold environments as long as you‚Äôre moving. Reserve those extra layers for when you‚Äôre sleeping, because you‚Äôre not moving around at all.

33. Bring around an extra pair of socks. Aside from the fact that they can help keep you warm, socks are really good for a lot of things, such as filtering water and suspending small objects off branches. Wearing socks when you‚Äôre in the wilderness will also keep you from getting blisters, which is likely to happen when you‚Äôre walking around and exploring the wilderness all day. Plus, these are pieces of warm clothing that are very easy to dry out in case they get wet.

34. Treat those blisters! Blisters can be a literal pain, and they happen a lot when you‚Äôre out in the wilderness. If you have a blister, take a needle and a string and poke a hole between two opposite ends of the blister. This will drain the water out and allow the blister to heal faster. If you think you‚Äôre about to get a blister, use duct tape to cover the area. This will prevent the blister from forming in the first place because it minimizes friction.

35. Balance food and water. Too much of either one can be harmful, if not fatal to your body. If you‚Äôre dehydrated, do not eat anything until you‚Äôve had water because the food will only absorb the remaining water in your body and cause you to be dehydrated even more. Drinking too much water can also mess up your metabolism and cause lots of complications long term. Always make sure you have enough of both food and water.
Here's a video showing about Sending out an S.O.S.

36. Learn how to do S.O.S, among other survival tactics. This signal is literally a lifesaver, so you need to know how to do it in both light and sound. The signal is represented by three dots followed by three dashes, followed by three more dots. In sound, this means having three quick taps followed by three slow taps, and then three more quick taps. The same can be applied to using light signals. Make sure you practice this before you go out there.

37. Know the universal ‚Äúwave.‚Äù Stand up with your legs apart. Raise both your arms and wave them up and down. You‚Äôll look like you‚Äôre doing jumping jacks, only without the jumps.

38. Setting up camp in the proper location is the first of all outdoor survivor techniques. The rule is to stay high and dry. Staying dry means you stay away from bodies of water, as convenient as it may seem. This is because water attracts both insects and animals; the presence of either near your camp could cause complications. Higher ground also means a better view of your surroundings while making it easy for rescuers to spot you. You can also work on picking a place that makes your camp easy to spot from the sky.

39. Use fungus to start fires easily. Coal fungus and horse hoof fungus have both very flammable properties. Break the fungus in half and you‚Äôll reveal their flammable parts right in the core. They easily catch sparks. Most of these fungi are usually found in dead trees, which means you‚Äôve got a good source of dry material there as well. What makes fungi particularly unique as tinder is that they smoulder ‚Äì all you have to do is to blow into the ember to make the fire grow. Because of this, they make portable firelighters as well.

40. Make an easy torch. Torches are pretty useful to wave at a rescue team from above. It‚Äôs also a good way to light your path during the night if your flashlights die on you. To make one, take a long branch and split the tip in half. Take some tree bark and insert them between the split branches. Ignite it and you‚Äôve got yourself a torch. Birch trees are pretty ideal for this because of their flammable material.
Check this out: Another tip in collecting rain water

41. Collect rainwater from all around you. After a rainfall, you can bet that moss, leaves, and all sorts of plants around you are wet. Collecting bundles of them and wringing them over a container can net you as much as a litre of water. Make sure you check out the tall grass as well. This is good for collecting fresh water because rainwater is guaranteed to be clean. This is also one of the easiest ways to collect water without having to purify it. Alternatively, you can also rub your clothes against the grass and wring out the moisture that gets stuck unto them.

42. Invest in waterproofing as much as survival tips and tricks. This means going for waterproof versions of equipment (i.e. watches and compasses) and getting equipment that will keep your other stuff protected from water. Always use containers that have waterproof seals and never mix anything damp with all your other drop stuff. This is especially important for food containers, because moisture can only hasten spoilage. Water may be essential for hydration, but for everything else, staying as dry as possible is a must for survival.

43. Filtering water is one of the most important survival skills. You never know what‚Äôs inside a stream or river. It has all sorts of stuff that you probably don‚Äôt want in your system. Grab a sock and fill them with charcoal. Follow it up with a layer of sand and then finally a layer of grass. The grass will catch the large particles in the water while the sand will filter out the fine granules. The charcoal will purify the water of any harmful chemicals.

44. Reflect heat around the campfire. Even without aluminium foil or space blanket, you can still conserve heat from a fire by creating a natural reflector. First, create four stakes that will serve as a rack next to the campfire. Stack green (as in fresh) stakes into the rack until they pile up into a small wall next to the campfire. This will reflect heat otherwise blown away by the wind, giving them all to you. This will work as long as you sit across the reflector.
Here's a video about how to use a signal mirror

45. Always have two signal mirrors. Relying on one signal mirror isn‚Äôt a good idea because the sun always travels south. This means that a single mirror will not allow you to catch the attention of rescuers flying from the north. The second signal mirror will be essential to reflect the light you get from the south to reflect it into the northern direction. Simply hold one of the mirrors facing south and another facing north, making sure that the light bounces off both

46. Learn about the medicinal properties of nature‚Äôs products around you. Crab apples, for instance, have healing properties in their raw form. They possess astringents that can be rubbed across cuts and lacerations, causing the wounds to tighten and heal faster. Pine resin, on the other hand, are great antiseptics. They can be used topically on wounds or gargled to clean the mouth. They‚Äôre usually found in solidified form within the tree, but you have to melt them first before using. If found fresh and still gooey, you can apply the substance immediately.

47. Fight intestinal infections with acorns! These, along with oak bark are rich in butyric acid that combats the effects of diarrhoea, among other things. Additionally, you can make medicinal tea by brewing them in hot water. The tea alone will help you fight intestinal problems like dysentery and cholera. You can also use the tea to help treat mouth ulcers. This tip also applies to blackberry leaves. They have less butyric acid than acorns but they will help as well.
‚ÄãHere's a video about how to make a rose hips tea

48. Fight constipation with other kinds of tea. On the other hand, the fleshy part of rose hips can be used to treat constipation. The outer shell, on the other hand, provides lots of vitamin C. You can also make tea out of dandelions. The plant is edible as well.

49. Dock leaves are instant antihistamines. For those who get bitten by bugs, simply take the sap of these leaves and mix it with saliva. Apply the mixture to help relieve some of the discomfort while effectively preventing the bite or sting from getting worse.
Here's a video about how to make a willow bark tea

50. Willow barks are natural aspirins. Chewing on the middle barks of a willow tree are known to have helped with sudden headaches or colds. Don‚Äôt try this if you know yourself to be allergic to aspirin.

Remember, it‚Äôs always much better to know more than less of the best survival tips when you find yourself in the wilderness.

- one sheet of paper towel roll, ripped length-wise, at a width of your desire
- one large candle of your choosing
- and last but not least, a lighter

Steps: 
1) light your candle
2) use one strip (or more, if you're feeling adventurous) of paper towel, and starting from the bottom, wrap it around your four toothpicks
3) blow out candle
4) dip your fingers, or toothpick-paper towel wrap into the wax, and work it around the paper towel, continue doing this until the whole paper towel-toothpick wrap is covered
5) light it. It should produce a fairly large amount of light, plus it's small enough that you can bring it anywhere, and put it in just about anything.

Please forgive the lack of pictures. I can't seem to link off my mobile, which I get to use when they aren't using me during surgery. I am way too busy at home to get online.

Hit Harbor Freight on the way home and bought a brick chisel, blade about 4.5"" span, thickness tapers from about 5/16"" near the handle where it flares to very thin. Profile looks like a putty knife.  5/8"" hex handle about 6"". long. I cut off the handle about 2"" long and ground the sides of the stem to about 3/8"" side to side and 5/8""  top to bottom. Then I ground the top/bottom to a tapered spike from 5/8"" to a point over 2"" length.  I  ground a little sweep into the blade of the chisel, rounding it out for a better bite, and ground about a 25* hollow grind blade angle best I could.  Took forever on the bench grinder and circular saw cut-off wheel.  http://i.imgur.com/lL8WTbJ.jpg

I went to my junk pile and grabbed a well dried 6' pear branch with a knob where a fork was. I had vague ambitions of carving a wizard staff from it or something. Pear is not very tough wood, not like apple or hickory, so I wanted to see how it would hold.  Chopped it to length using the head as a hand axe,  then used the axe blade and a baton, kinda chisel like, to carve the fork area down to a flattish face, leaving a little of the burly wood for strength. I wrapped some rope around the head end for a "" foot vise"" and used the blade as a draw knife to narrow and shape the handle, making an oval cross section. Head end was @3""  dia. Grip end was closer to 2x1-1/2"".  Whole handle about 40"" long, Including 5"" or so sticking above the axe's head.

I planted the head in a splitting stump and drilled partway into the handle, pilot hole-style, by pushing the handle down on the spike and twisting it.  Once I had a hole started, going in the right direction, and maybe an inch deep, I hammered it into place with a chunk of wood.  It was stubborn going, but I got most of it buried, pulled the head from the stump, and took a swing at firewood log to really bury the spike.
http://i.imgur.com/iiOpNVw.jpg

I heard a loud crack and was worried. When I looked, the spike had come out the back, lifting a small split out the back where it came out. WHEW!  No problem. The spike was buried, the arch of the chisel snug up against the face, and everything very tight and nothing split or cracked.  The head was very snug.  First test was chopping and splitting a few firewood logs, green cherry, dried ash, some plum bowstave rejects, ....making and mounting the handle took 15min tops, but I admit I didn't have to look for a branch.


To really test it, I took it out on a tree job; a gigantic weeping willow. I took the tree down with chainsaws of course, the trunk was 4' across.  I usually use a machete and ditch axe (briar axe) on little stuff and chainsaws on big stuff to break it up, move it, and load in  the truck. (No chipper). This time I used the Celt on anything trom tiny, up to about the size of my upper thigh, to put It through It's paces. I loaded two dumptruck loads using just the axe, except on big logs. That's a 20' x8' x6' dump bed on an old Chevy C-50 two and a half ton pickup. 8"" or smaller got the axe. http://i.imgur.com/lL8WTbJ.jpg    

well, she  WORKS great. It axes as well as any axe I've used. The side taper is just enough to prevent it getting stuck, but it bites deep and cuts well. Now, this WAS green willow, so it isn't tough to cut, but the axe performed just fine. It DID NOT split the stick handle. It did not drive itself deeper and deeper. It took nice big, deep bites, as well or better than a ""real"" axe of simar weight/length. Made good chips and did agreat job. I would not feel handicapped at all with one of these, even in a necessity scenario. I could build a cabin, or chop firewood with this axe as well as any I have used. http://i.imgur.com/vujMV8V.jpg

NOW, it did have some drawbacks. I had no trouble splitting logs up to 6"" plus with sidestrikes (the ends were pointed from axing), but the wood behind the head did make contact. End sawn logs were more stubborn, so yeah, the ability to split cordwood by striking through, is poor. This did batter up the wood around the head, kinda like ov erstriking with a regular axe. I eventually could see a cracked beat up area near the head mount, definitely caused by overstriking, not the head wedging and splitting, but the head remained tight, and further use didn't open that split.

For the same reason, if a log was much thicker than the head is long, I started making contact with the sides of the ""V"" I was chopping out. This would steal the energy from your swing, mostly, but resulted in my having to make the ""V"" wider and more obtusely angled. It took a little more chopping to section those thicker logs than with a regulr axe, and In the last thread this was hypothesized to be the reason you often see celt-mounted heads than are long. This was in a Slash pile. If I could have rolled the logs, then stuff up to 10"" across would have been fine.

Eventually, after maybe 5 hours of continuous use, the handle did break, BUT not by the head, nor from wedging. It eventually broke down by the grip, where a knot had been chopped off and the grain violated. About a foot broke off the grip end.  I hadn't expected that, and I don't think any of the guys replying in the previous thread did, either.

Another problem is that after a good bit of use, rather than wedging in further, the head would pop out if you overstruck hard, and the extra clubby end that protrudes above the head, plus a big tangled pile had the same result. That long tip would make contact and tangle up in the slash or hit something and stop, spitting out the head. So maybe some more taper would be helpful. I don't think this would happen if the stem didn't end abruptly where the blade flares.

In short, it chops like mad and cuts absolutely wonderfully. I didn't feel handicapped at all, and while a commerially made axe with an eye has advantages, it's not a world of difference.  I'm positive a green lodgepole or spruce handle, or something similar would be similar to the pear, maybe better. I aim to put a hard maple or rock elm handle on it next just to see if it'll last.  

This head is heavy enough that carrying a hatchet would be nearly the same, as far as carrying,  but this produced a lightish, full sized axe. I took full strength, two handed swings with it for hours and did real work. 15 min for the handle could be cut down to a few minutes for a shorter -lived handle. Experiment successful. I like it.

Next up, an even smaller, pocket sized head, as soon as I find some shop time...

"I tend to think, lately, that the vast majority of ""survivalists"" have their priorities way out of whack.",15,31ptwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/31ptwx/i_tend_to_think_lately_that_the_vast_majority_of/,9,1428412771.0,"Let's get this out of the way first: There are a handful of rare stories here and there about folks who became lost in the wilderness and needed to use their wits to survive. Some were successful, others weren't. But the common thread here is that these stories are *rare*. Being lost in the wild and needing to resort to ""survival techniques"" is an extremely rare occasion. Honestly, as a side note, I would be very interested indeed to see if those who have studied survival techniques actually tend to fare better in dire circumstances versus the average joe.

That said, I think a whole lot of folks who fantasize about survivalism have a very skewed notion of the reality of these situations. First of all, they aren't fun, clearly. Second of all, in the unlikely event you find yourself in a wilderness survival situation, it's even more unlikely you'll find yourself doing things like building a bow, atl-atl or spear, setting traps for game, trying to make some kind of wilderness frying pan, smoking/preserving meat, or any of countless other practices that imply you're planning on months of being out in the woods.

If you find yourself in a wilderness survival situation, your concern, first of all, is making sure you can stay alive, and second of all, *getting the fuck out of there*. So meeting these requirements really generally boils down to knowing how to protect yourself from the elements, addressing possible wounds, staying hydrated, *possibly* making a fire, navigation, and signaling.

If you have a cell phone and a signal, game over, you've won. If you have a GPS or map/compass and the skills to use them, and are fit enough to find your way out, then game over, you've won. The reason we don't hear very much about actual survival situations is because the majority of folks have taken simple, common sense precautions to prevent these kind of situations from happening in the first place.

The large majority of posts we see on /r/survival are gear posts. The thought occurred to me lately, ""Each time you purchase new gear, you're telling yourself 'I'm too stupid to do without this'"". (And I don't mean that in the sense of, if you buy a ferro rod you're too stupid to know how to make a fire with a bow drill- I'm saying you're too stupid to know how to keep yourself out of a situation where you have to make a fire to survive. I'm guilty of this too.) I'll bet you a hundred of my Reddit karma that if you cite any actual reported survival situation that has occurred, I can find several, simple things the person could have done to not wind up in that situation to begin with.

Remember, there are natives who have lived in your area for thousands of years without ferro rods, compasses, steel knives, or any of that shit. They were smart enough to not get themselves into bad situations to begin with. The mantra is, ""knowledge weighs nothing"". And when it comes to survival knowledge, the best knowledge is knowing how not to wind up in a ""survival situation"" in the first place. I think while a whole lot of folks are busy learning how to rub sticks together to make fire, how to craft the perfect deadfall, how to heat water with hot rocks, what they really should be learning is how to tell people where they've gone and expect to be back, how to read a topographic map and use a compass, how to navigate in the woods, finding handrails, backstops, etc. How to stabilize a broken limb, how to traverse difficult terrain with an injury, how to be found by rescuers.

I think people tend to forget the nature of ""wilderness SURVIVAL"" and how to differentiate between that and other hobbies like bushcraft and camping. I have certainly been guilty of this myself but I think it bears mentioning.

By all means, if these kind of skills interest and thrill you, I think that's great, learn them. It's a dying art and they're skills that need to be passed on. But when it comes to keeping your ass alive in a bad situation in the woods, your priorities are to stay alive and get out of there. I would love to see more posts elucidating in fine detail the basics instead of ""what's the best knife"" and ""how do I make a snare trap"" type of stuff.

At the Risk of Sounding like a Complete Imbecile...

For several months now, I've just been practicing every day.  I've been using things like:  Slingshot, Rock-Sling, Staff-Sling, Sling-Bow, Boomerang, Blowgun, Rabbit Stick, Spear, and of course - simply throwing rocks.  

My only successes are 1 squirrel kill with a Cold Steel Boomerang (not a returner, by the way).  And several trout kills with blowgun, spear, and sling-bow.  

Today I found out that these are ALL ILLEGAL METHODS OF HUNTING IN VA.

I just cannot wrap my head around that.  Is the reasoning for this just ""Since we cannot regulate these weapons, they will be made illegal for hunting""?  I would think that the ""Bureau of Wildlife"" (the people who made the laws), would want to give wildlife a chance - not completely remove it.  How can it be okay to hunt with a high-powered rifle, but not with a spear?  

I just really wanted to rant for a moment, but I'd also like to hear some reasoning.  The weapons themselves aren't illegal - but using them for any form of hunting or fishing IS illegal.  So I am allowed to go out and practice with it, but if they catch me with a fresh kill, I'm boned :/.

Someone please enlighten me?

Anyway, my girlfriend and I love to camp and hike and such, we have our gear and never run into problems with tents, starting fires, etc.  We're always curious though about how people used to do things, i.e. pre-industrial revolution or even rural living mid-industrial revolution. Ultimately our discussions always get to homesteading, but without big machinery.
For example, we understand the idea behind a water mill.  The water flows, a few cogs later, something is turning in a building and that helps you grind stuff...  I guess our question is how do you make/utilize it?  How did people used to plant and sow seeds?  Grind wheat down to flour?  Spin wool? Etc.

We always end up here, and while I have a 1970's medicine in the wilderness book (which is epic and thorough,) we're always looking for a book that explains how to, essentially, create a homestead that doesn't involve ""buy a big tractor.""

The steel is easy to sharpen and holds it up pretty well.

Survival tabletop skills,0,9ad4i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/9ad4i4/survival_tabletop_skills/,8,1535287408.0,"Hey folks, how's it going? I should first say that I'm on mobile, so sorry for any resulting issues. With that being said, here's what's on my mind.

Long story short, I thought it would be interesting to combine my old passion for game design and my newfound passion for bushcraft and survival. And to that end, I have begin dreaming up a survival based tabletop RPG.

While considering the various skills the player characters should have access to, I want to make sure I have all the survival skills that might potentially be relivent. I won't waste your time with the skills unique to the game world, such as Spirit Summoning or Shapeshifting, but I'd like to pick your brains about the more mundane ones.

I should also say that the people of the game world are very primitive compared to us, about the height of their technology is the ocasional log house. They're still, more or less, Stone age cave people.

With that being said, the survival skills I have so far are:

Gathering: Foraging and searching around the local environment. Either for one specific object/person, or looking for food or building materials or something of that sort.

Firecraft: The building and maintaining of fires, and using fire as a tool to accomplish other tasks like cooking.

Navigation: Knowing where you are, where you're going, and the best way to get there. Either in this world or the spirit world.

Medicine: Cleaning and repairing wounds, using the correct herbs to cure a belly ache, and anything else related to using the natural world to help make people well. Also usable for the opposite goal, such as purposefully setting a broken bone to not heal correctly or poisoning someone.

Tracking: Following the trail left by someone or something, whether the target wishes to be found or not.

Artisanry: The making and repairing of tools, whether they be as simple as a sharp piece of flint, or as complex as a masterfully crafted longbow.

Hunting: Knowledge of game, how to hunt and trap it, how to break down a carcass and use every bit, and everything else a primitive hunter would know.

Archery: Bow + arrow + good eye = dinner, not much else to explain.

Sheltering: Either knowing how to find and properly use an already existing shelter such as a cave, or building a shelter from scratch.

So that's the list of survival based skills I have in mind for my RPG so far. Does anyone notice anything I left out? Or anything I included that I shouldn't have?

Survival At Sea. Is it better to drink a little bit of salt water?,8,64o8x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/64o8x1/survival_at_sea_is_it_better_to_drink_a_little/,57,1491907558.0,"So I've always heard never to drink any seawater if you're out at sea, and that seemed like obvious advice. 

Recently I've been looking at fasting to train my will power and better prepare mentally for a survival situation. When fasting, it's ideal if you get vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Normally, people do this by taking a multi-vitamin, mineral supplements, electrolyte supplements (which include salt). 

I'm doing a fast today and as I threw back a small glass of salty water, a thought hit me. **If I was stranded at sea, wouldn't it be better to drink a small quantity of salt water to get some electrolytes?** 

Let's have a look at some of the facts I found:

* On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 0.600 M) This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (40%) and chloride (60%) ions).

* 1500 mg of sodium is the recommended daily amount, that amounts to 0.75 teaspoons or 3.75 grams of salt per day.

* The chloride recommended dietary allowance for men aged 9 - 50 is 2300mg. 

If we drank 110ml, that would mean we would get 3.85 grams of salt, which would work out to 1500mg of sodium and 2250mg of chloride. 

Is there something wrong in my reasoning, or would it indeed be better to drink 110ml of seawater a day if you were stranded at sea? Obviously it would be better to space out the intake over the day to lessen the strain on your kidneys.",survival

I dont know if he is aware of it, but he is damn good at it. We live in a village and it is  more of a wilderness than a civilized village here. And this guy who works as a plumber and has no training on survival whatsoever, is always busy protecting his house from snakes, scorpions, martens and all kinds of animals. I dont like him, but I've learned to respect him over time.

But what he did this year was truly a marvel of survival. Somehow he inherited a piece of land in the middle of nowhere, just some pile of dirt on a mountain that nobody would give a damn about. He doesnt have a lot of money obviously, but that didnt stop him from building himself a house. On a fucking mountain. So what he did was grabbing the shovel and the pickaxe and giving the land some shape. After that, he would just go and buy bricks, wood, cement etc ""whenever he could afford it"". He always bought an amount that he could use up, so there would be no materials lying on the ground when he came back to his house. Anyway, doing this for over a year, going out there and continuing from where he left off, and getting help from his brother once in a while, he finished building it. I haven't seen it myself, but when we talked about it, he said it was ""enough"". But when he says enough, I know that place is completely fitted with electricity and running water.

Now after all this, he has a place where he can escape the summer heat, lay back on his chair and enjoy a cold drink. It's a mountain, but hey, he was always fighting off the wilderness anyway. In the modern days, there are tons of survival kits that can help you light a fire, clean some water, acquire some food etc. Even if you dont have the skills to do these, technology can. But building a shelter no matter the landscape, this is the true survival skill right here. More importantly *his will to do it*.

I know you guys will have some advice for this. I have ideas for what sorts of things I want, but I have no idea what products are available, much less which ones are right for me.

-

This is my list of things to research and buy:

-2 reliable, medium sized backpacks

-1 small first aid kit

-A water purifying device (preferably no filters or tablets needed)

-2 hand crank flashlights (in case batteries become scarce)

-1 hand crank radio

-A map of my local area

-A small booklet of survival related docs, pdfs, books... whatever I think is necessary

-A firestarting kit? Looking for something highly sustainable, will settle for matches if that's honestly the best.

-1 sidearm w/ammo (so clueless, please help)

-Urban/Wilderness tools such as but not limited to a crowbar and hatchet

-2-person tent, tarp, sleeping bags (probably the only equipment I'm knowledgable enough to pick out myself)

Well, that's my plan so far. If anyone has any specific recommendations for these items I would be much obliged. Also, I'm sure you fine gents will have advice/analyses about my kit so please let me know your thoughts, and thank you for taking the time to help.",survival

I wanted to add a bit of utility to it, given its simplicity.  I strapped a molle 9mm pouch onto the sheath, and so far have a magnesium block,  ferro rod, serrated striker, and tinder in there.  Wrapped onto the sheath I wove a bit of paracord, running top to bottom and ending in a figure 8 on one end and a slipknot on the other.  they can hang free, or slip the noose over the big 8 and form a ring to cary whatever, or attach to whatever.  On the back of the sheath I have a piece of duct tape with two needles, one heavy duty one normal.  I thought of putting some small pairing nails in there too, given the kabar pommel can be used as a hammer.  Ill try to get a photo up but I dont have an imigur account and I have midterms, so it might take a minute.  What would you add and why?  Thanks r/survival

I'm writing a short story in which eight people are drifting on a motor boat in the middle of the ocean. They only have 1900's technology, some water, a destroyed engine, no radio, but everything else you would expect on a ship of moderate size, perhaps eighty feet. Rescue is about ten days out.
What could they do for survival in terms of water? The weather his sunny, hot and humid, but otherwise calm. Also, they don't got any kerosine or easily combustible fuel.

1) Water collection through evaporation of seawater and urine. How much could you expect to get from this on a daily basis?

2) Can you filter your urine in other ways? Through socks or leggings or such?

3) Capture humidity at night. How much could you expect? I guess you would use a sail or tarps and funnel it to a barrel?

4) Are there other ways to get water besides those I mentioned? I know you could theoretically squeeze fresh water from fish's eyes and bones, but that seems like a small amount and heavily dependent on your luck in fishing.

5) What else would a survival minded person do in such a scenario? Not eat, sleep alot, keep out of the sun. Pebble in the mouth to trap spit,

Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be Mace Windu. Why? He had a purple lightsaber. Plus, Samuel L. Jackson played Mace Windu, which makes him seem one thousand times cooler now.  

Being a Star Wars character means being able to travel to different planets and moons. Some places can be dangerous and scary. If you ever find yourself on the Forest Moon of Endor, sometimes just referred to as Endor, would you know how to survive?

If you are unfamiliar with your Star Wars references, Endor is the moon where the Ewoks live. It looks a lot like the Redwood Forests in California‚Ä¶. Oh right, that is because the movie was filmed there. 

So maybe you are not a space travelling human, but you may find yourself stranded and needing to survive in conditions similar to Endor here on Earth. Luckily, you will not have to fend off any Goraxes on Earth. 

There are three basic needs of survival that you will need to address: water, shelter and food. 

1 . Water on a Near Waterless Planet

Finding water on Endor is extremely difficult because only 8% of the surface is covered in water. The rest of the forest moon is covered by terrain, mostly forests.

If you got lucky, there may be a stream, lake, or river you could drink from. To find surface water you should follow other animals and species. They tend to know where the watering holes are, but you may follow them for too long. Imagine following something like a camel. 

Finding surface water will be difficult on Endor, so your best bet is to capture rainwater or dig. 

You could set up a container to capture rainwater and then filter it out. You could also dig for muddy water and then purify it. If you still cannot find water, then you may need to walk downhill, since water always travels down.

2. Finding a Shelter

Finding a shelter on Endor should be relatively simple. You have ample amounts of wood and vines so that you could build yourself an awesome fort and shelter. 

You could build an entire city using the wood and vines on the Forest Moon of Endor. On top of that, you have a ton of foliage that you can easily cover your shelter with, make a bed, and use as blankets. Just do not grab something poisonous.

3. Find Food

Ever wondered what an Ewok would taste like? Yeah, probably would not taste very good, plus they are friends to the Jedi. I would hate for you to attack the Unidentified Ewok Jedi. 

For quick food, eat some berries or insects. There tends to be ample amounts of berries in places like Endor. Just watch out for the poisonous ones.

To test if plants and berries are poisonous, you should test slowly. First, rub against your skin, then your lips, then tongue, chew it for a long time, swallow a small bit, then proceed to eat if none of it gave you a reaction.  

If you need to cook something, you are in luck. The Forest Moon of Endor is filled mostly with Diorite and Feldspar, which are great minerals for creating pots, pans and bowls. 

Get your hand on some and you could make yourself some nice stuff that you could take home to your mom when you are finally rescued.

Did anyone watch Running Wild with Bear Grylls and Michelle Rodriguez? He calls himself a survival expert? Oy vey!,96,3gl36u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/3gl36u/did_anyone_watch_running_wild_with_bear_grylls/,112,1439325040.0,"On Bear's show running on [NBC this summer,](http://www.nbc.com/running-wild-with-bear-grylls/episode-guide/season-2/michelle-rodriguez/205) he gets a celebrity out into the wild for 2 days and supposedly shows them survival techniques. 

Last night he had Michelle Rodriguez from Fast & Furious and they parachute into the red rock desert of Nevada's Valley of Fire. Obviously Michelle knows the basic techniques of sky diving except no one taught her how to land going into the wind, and she crashes into a ridge. Some how she gets out unscathed.

Then they climb into the rocks and do rappelling. Funny how Bear always has sketchy anchors for his ropes and never a safety line, and funny how he taught Michelle to sky dive but not now to rappel. But they get down.   

Then it gets to the end of the day, and we see the real Grylls craziness. He finds a mouse on a rock wall - just happens to be there with all the camera men, sound guys, support staff and Michelle and Bear. He catches it,  (ever heard of Hantavirus, Bear?) guts it, and has be brilliant idea of making mouse stew boiled in urine. He says boiling urine makes it safe because it kills the bacteria, they share the mouse and drink the leftover urine.  Oh my God! In the Nevada desert they need a minimum of 4 liters/day + 1 liter for every 2 - 3 miles hiked. If all they had was a cup of urine and 1 mouse between 2 people for 2 days in the desert, they would be dead people. Think about the [French couple who died](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/us/new-mexico-french-deaths/index.html) in New Mexico this last week after less than  half a day.  It's unbelievable that Grylls keeps telling people to drink urine in his shows when every survival manual and survival expert says no. The literature says the only way you can use urine in the desert is in a solar still. 

Ok, they make it through the night, but still have the taste of urine in their mouths, eww, then they have to climb up a rock wall using ascenders and foot slings on ropes Bear previously fixed. They are doing a very technical climb up what Bear calls a 350 ft incline on 1/2 mouse each and 1/2 cup of urine. Right.  

It seems like Bear gets a lot of deserved criticism of his ""survival techniques"", but this episode takes it to a new low.  ",survival

1. I was a boy scout/cub scout for about 10 years in my youth. Although I did not achieve the rank of eagle scout I thoroughly enjoyed my time and excelled in all areas relating to the wild.

2. I have been on many family trips to the Sierra Nevadas and have camped in various places. So I have a good understanding of its geography.

3. Other than that I have a huge passion for the wilderness and have been considering this for a long time.

**Here is my current personal state of being and current intentions for the trip:**

1. I will be graduating from college in Southern California with a degree in Chemical Engineering (So I'm not a complete idiot).

2. I have a bunch of gear and will not need to buy too much in order to be ready for the trip.

3. I plan on doing this in the summer of 2015 and continue into the fall or winter depending on if I'm ready to rejoin society.

4. I plan on doing this alone. That being said I will format it so I contact family and friends at least once every couple of weeks.

5. I plan on being on the move somewhat continuously so that I will not be bored. Most likely follow the PCT.

6. I will need to brush up on camping skills and personal fitness before I go.

7. I am doing this to see if I can do it and to ""find myself"" a bit.

**What I want to discuss:**

1. How best to deal with the food situation. (Beside what I pack and acquire from civilization how should I plan to live off the land with small game and wild plants etc) (I was planning on pulling a Chris McCandless and mostly live off beans and/or rice)

2. What are the laws about camping and small game hunting in the various state and national parks in the Sierra Nevadas. (What can I get away with)

3. Any tips about how to prepare my body for the trip. (I have started a workout regimen and have started outlining a process of adjusting my diet)

4. Has anyone done this before and do they have any tips?

**I have about a year before I start this and therefore HAVE to start planning now. I look forward to see what comes from this post. P.S. I love this sub btw**",survival

In a nutshell, that test walks users through determining the edibility of plants in a slow, step-by-step manner with time intervals between each step.

Part of the app would be a computer vision model that helps identify known poisonous species to avoid them entirely. We understand that this is dangerous territory, and plan only to ID known poisonous plants. To prevent dangerous misidentification, for anything that is not identified as poisonous we will suggest a user goes through the Universal Edibility Test, and we'll walk them through that test with the required timers. We believe this is a valuable test to know, and we think by practicing with the app, users can learn to conduct this test themselves if they ever need it.

We expect users to bring this app along on a secondary device that will remain powered off to save battery unless it's needed. We understand that electronic devices, machine learning models, battery life, etc. are all fallible, but we still think there is use in helping to educate people interested in survival skills in the right way to conduct the edibility test in a survival situation.

We‚Äôre looking for beta testers, and we'd love /r/Survival‚Äôs feedback.

Broomstick Spell,23,jbs5gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/jbs5gs/broomstick_spell/,1,1602811868.0,"So many witch hunters claimed that women rubbed their broomsticks with ergot and then used them on their feminine parts, showing the evil inherent in women for being overly sexual and ‚Äòflying‚Äô. The broomstick really should be a symbol of revolt by witches and warlocks alike.

I have faced so much criticism, cynicism, and general abuse for being a witch. When at its worst I can think that we are no better off than during the witch hunts of old.

The main complaint that I get is that I am using stupid gullible people (to what end hasn‚Äôt been explained to me yet) and that it is against God‚Äôs Law (whatever THAT is)

So in order to con the gullible (if you consider yourselves to be so?) and go against God‚Äôs (undefined) law, I made a samhain video about broomsticks, their folk lore and how to use them. Many witches have asked me this as Sweeping Magic is great for many many different uses and my latest offering tries to address the rituals and rites you would use a broomstick for....... as well as can you fly on them...........!

Are there spells to implant ideas into someone's head? And would this go against free will?,4,j9u84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j9u84k/are_there_spells_to_implant_ideas_into_someones/,3,1602549265.0,"I'm still a little witchling, I'm sorry.

Here is my situation: My family is looking for a new home as the house we rent is being sold. My great grandmother is 91 and still lives alone but relies heavily in my grandparents who live a few minutes from her. They are very charitable people with a large home and have taken her in during rough times in the past. I would assume she will be living with them permanently in the near future. 

If my great grandmother was to leave her home, it would likely remain empty as my aunts and uncles own their own homes ans my cousins are in college. Renting to my family would be an ideal situation in my mind. A stable/ permanent home for us, extra income for my grandparents/great grandmother, a great school system for my kids(the schools in her town are better than the ones in mine), keep the house in the family, put us closer to my extended family-which would allowe to help take care of my great grandmother and for my kids to spend more time with her while she is still here. 

I don't have the courage to bring up this idea with my grandparents or great grandmother. They have helped us out a LOT in the past and it would just feel wrong to ask them for more. But if they were to present the idea, I'd enthusiastically agree. I've been manifesting, I just want to do more.

I've had a break up in July of this year (2020) and ever since it I've been devastated. Our relationship was everything for me, and I truly felt a incredibly deep connection with her, like she was my soulmate. Some might not believe me on this, but I also didn't until we met. It was, or at least felt, like a perfect relationship with the right person. But well, she broke up with me.

I would have been much worse if it wasn't for a friend of mine that taught me sigil magic and how to make a servitor. This servitor I made currently works (mostly) at night, when the mind is more influentiable and dark/black magic is stronger, and it makes her love me more than she already does.

However, as the days passes I start to become insecure, afraid or anxious with the lack of results or progress. I don't doubt it can work, but because it can only influence her (can't overcome her free will) I feel like it will take too long for me. I have self-control, but to use a servitor for months without seeing progress doesn't feel different from white magic or prayers.

I come here in search of a powerful love spell that has worked before and will bring her back to me in a short time. My biggest concern is that she won't come back to me by free will, so I would like to know spells that are above it. I will deal with whatever consequences that come with them afterwards, so don't expect me to change my mind about doing it by telling me the consequences beforehand.

And before you come to me to talk about your spellcaster services for a small price or a big price that 100% works and is totally not a scam, I'm not paying you. I don't have a international credit card and I highly doubt you can offer me what I want in a price I can afford.",spells

Thought I'd share a spell which I performed last new moon which has been working really well for me. It can also be performed on a Wednesday (Mercury - Commerce) during a waxing moon (growth period).

Ingredients: 1 Charcoal Disk in a fireproof dish & Benzoin resin granules / Matches / Chopped Basil (dried or fresh) / 1 green candle (I'd recommend no less than 6hr burn time) / 1 yellow candle / 1 Small broom or hand brush / Large bunch fresh Rosemary / 2 yards twine or string / 30cm string of dried juniper berries / 6 drops of mint essential oil

Casting the Spell:

1. Cast the circle (search the sub if you are not sure how, there will be other instructions for how to open / close a circle)
2. Light the charcoal disk and sprinkle on the Benzoin & Basil
3. Light the green candle and say ""Earth, witness this spell"". Light the yellow candle and say ""Air, carry it well""
4. Tie the Rosemary around the handle of the brush, then wrap the twine around until it is completely used, chanting as you do: ""Born of earth, carried in air, increase worth, away with care"". Fasten it off then tie the string of berries around the twine.
5. Anoint the handle & brush with the Mint oil. Pass the brush over the incense smoke 3 times, saying ""Once I invest thee, Twice I impress thee, Thrice I then bless thee"". Leave the brush with the candles until they burn out.
6. Keep the brush over the doorway of your business (I work from home so keep mine over my front door)

Hope this is useful for someone. Let me know if you have any q's. The spell is taken from the book 'The Spells Bible' by Ann-Marie Gallagher.

My mother deserves to be treated right, as well as the rest of my family, and me and my sister are constantly afraid of being around him. I think it‚Äôs for the best that he leaves us, I definitely do not think they are meant to be or that myself and the rest of my family are destined to be emotionally scarred the rest of our lives. 

I‚Äôve always been a firm believer in magic, but I‚Äôm inexperienced with attempting to use it myself. So I was wondering if anyone might have experience with a situation like this, or knows any spells that might help, or if anyone knows anyone I could go to for getting help. I also don‚Äôt want to hurt my mother as I know some break-up spells can be rather nasty for both sides. 
I‚Äôve been thinking to start with a break-up spell, then a banishment with the intention of breaking them apart and for him to leave us alone, but any tips are definitely appreciated :)",spells

Are call me spells dangerous?,2,j2nbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2nbev/are_call_me_spells_dangerous/,1,1601505425.0,"I did a freezer spell first just to stop thinking about this person and keep him from pooping back up and it seemed to work and then I wanted to connect with him again because I still have feelings for him. He was just a nice person. He was never mean to me I just knew that it would t have worked cause we both have partners and I have a child. 

I used a call me spell awhile back and it worked within a month. He added me back on Facebook and we talked just a few times. But I know deep down inside it‚Äôs wrong cause he‚Äôs now married and I‚Äôm doing it for selfish reasons. I just miss talking to him. I don‚Äôt really want to break up his marriage I just want to talk to him as a friend where it‚Äôs not awkward and we can just talk like normal people. But I know that wouldn‚Äôt happen cause he and I both know the feelings are still there. He‚Äôs moved on and so have I but when we see each others name pop up the memories come back. Which is what I miss about it. Just talking about the old days and how close we were. 

Because I was ‚Äúbeing selfish‚Äù knowing that I‚Äôm messing with his free will, could I be conjuring up so bad luck? I‚Äôve done it twice in a short time frame and it works but it‚Äôs not a love spell where I want him to fall back in love with me it‚Äôs just a contact spell. I guess you can say I was manlipulating the situation. But my intent isn‚Äôt to break them up. I just miss talking to him. 

Has bad luck ever happened to anyone? Maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence.. nothing bad has really happened to myself except I‚Äôve been feeling more emotional and my anxiety is extremely bad and I‚Äôve been more angry with my relationship. Nothing physical to myself or my family has happened. I just want to see others experience.",spells

Manifesting With The Moon,28,j2fu9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2fu9h/manifesting_with_the_moon/,0,1601470846.0,"# Only approximately 239,00 miles away from the Earth, there is no doubt that the extraordinary, celestial mass in our night sky-- The Moon-- has powerful control over the Earth and its people.¬†

While the Sun represents masculine energy, the Moon represents the utmost powerful feminine energy. She signifies intuition, birth, death, and reincarnation and represents our hidden emotions, desires, worries, and self-work.

Spiritually, she acts as our Mama, subtly reminding her children that everything on Earth is ever-changing and follows a natural cycle. She offers us the ability to feel, nourish, learn from the past, and creatively unlock and express our authentic selves.

THE NEW MOON

The New Moon is the first phase in the Lunar cycle. It occurs when The Moon comes into direct alignment in the Sun. When the Sun becomes possessive of the Moon and he does not want to share her beauty with the Earth, we are shown emptiness representing a time for fresh starts and new beginnings. It‚Äôs time to rest and begin planting new seeds of desire and intention by writing them down. This is the time to meditate and gently breathe new life into any areas of stagnation in which you wish to thrive.

THE FULL MOON

The Full Moon follows the Waxing Gibbous. The Sun and the Moon are in harmony and the Sun reflects his brilliance off the Moon‚Äôs surface, creating her own light for us to use. This phase represents intense thoughts and powerful breakthroughs. Full moons are thought to influence humans so powerfully, there is a record of heightened emotions and even psychosis. This is the time to reflect. Allow yourself to analyze what‚Äôs working for you--or what‚Äôs not. Celebrate this realization-- this is the universe connecting with you.

&#x200B;

To make the work day go faster (try not to look at the clock too often after saying it and for an extra boost, repeat to yourself or out loud several times throughout the day 'I can't believe how fast the day's going' or 'wow. It's already lunchtime or whatever time'):

'Time flies when you're having fun.

But that is not now, so let it be done.

Let the time fly by so fast.

So that this work day will not last.'

&#x200B;

When I'm trying to do something creative and the Muse just won't flow:

'Muse of art, Muse of sound, Muse of thought gather round.

Come to me with your guiding light. Guide my hand in this creative rite.

And as I call your spirits forth, so shall it be.'

&#x200B;

When I need to focus OR could use a little boost of luck (works for both...just got to set the intention):

'Right time, right place

Sacred moment, sacred space

From sky above to earth below

I am in my perfect flow.'

&#x200B;

And finally, the most simple:

Simply repeat to yourself several time throughout the day:

 'Everything works out in my favor.'

I recently went to a metaphysical store to purchase some more crystals and Sage, while there I saw what I thought was a necklace with an amethyst stone and was drawn to it so I asked the cashier for it and she told me it was a pendulum then asked if I ever had one which I didn‚Äôt so she explained a little about it to me. Anyway I purchased my products got home and immediately watch one YouTube video on pendulums the video I watched the lady said to ask the pendulum questions or tell the pendulum things that u know the answer to in order to establish which way is yes or no so that‚Äôs what I did. The first thing I said to the pendulum was ‚Äúmy name is‚Äù and I gave my real name and the pendulum moved forward and back. Then I said ‚ÄúI have 4 daughters‚Äù which is true, and again the pendulum moved back and forth so I took back and forth to my mean yes. Then I said ‚ÄúI have one son,‚Äù (which I don‚Äôt, I only have 4 daughters) and the pendulum moved side to side, then I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an only child‚Äù and the pendulum moved side to side I‚Äôm actually the youngest of 5, so I took side to side to mean No. Now here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused. As I said this is my first pendulum so I‚Äôve been watching videos on it trying to learn more about it. But the more videos I watch people are saying to the pendulum ‚Äúshow me yes, show me no, maybe etc,‚Äù they‚Äôre not asking the pendulum questions or telling the pendulum things so that pendulum can show which way is yes or no. So thinking I already knew my pendulum yes and No answer I foolishly decided to test it out and asked it to show me yes please and it spun clockwise instead of back and forth, then I asked show me No and it went back and forth instead of side to side so now I‚Äôm not sure what yes and no really is with my pendulum. Did I mess it up by doing this, and do I need to do anything so that I can be sure of the answers instead of feeling unsure now?",spells

What does this mean,1,iw5nel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iw5nel/what_does_this_mean/,3,1600597529.0,"I did a breakup friendship spell on my ex and a female friend of his using candle magick. I did this spell because he has a few female friends which doesn't bother me since he knew them before meeting me. However with this particular female friend whenever he communicates with her the energy and vibe between us become different and conflict comes between us, I asked him if he has any feelings for her and he said No but admitted to me that she came onto him which is why I broke it off with him because he picked her up while she was in town and hungout with her and told me after the fact. To me she's a thorn between us and I am hoping he and I reconcile but I want her removed from his life.

So I found a spell online and tweaked it a little changing some of the words to fit what I wanted. As I was saying the spell his candle started normal size and was stabled however the candle for her sparked, and when I finished saying the spell I put the candles away from each other as instructed and let it burn. While it was burning both candles were the same color which was blue and gold but his more blue than hers, hers was more golden than blue. The flame for his candle started to get really low to the point I thought it would go out but it didn't and remained steady; however the flame for her candle was tall and unsteady, it blew, it danced, it sparked and popped and the more it did this the lower his flame got. But then his flame started to get taller, and brighter while remaining steady and her flame while still popping, dancing, blowing, and sparking started getting lower and calm down becoming steady. It got a little lower than his but not low enough to blow out. Eventually I fell asleep, but when I woke up the candle for her was nearly gone and the flame was out, but the candle for him was low but the flame was still there and remained there until I blew it out.  Can someone please tell me what this means, is this a good sign, a bad sign or what?

Intrusive or negative thoughts?,9,ivzbm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ivzbm4/intrusive_or_negative_thoughts/,10,1600573289.0,"Sometimes there are things that I think of that show up in my head that eventually end up doing more damage to not only myself but my relationship with a close friend of mine. Things like allowing a certain worry to build up inside of me until I feel I have no choice to speak to my friend about it, only for them to end up getting upset at me because of it.

Which in turn just gives rise to a new worry and concern of mine, will then go through the same cycle, getting myself worried to the point that said topic comes up in conversation and then end up harming the relationship further.

The worry I am experiencing is that we had an incident some three weeks ago. It took awhile to get them speaking to me again, though it is in a public discord and not a private chat like we usually are. I guess it is because they don't trust me enough to speak to me in a private setting at the moment.

There is a worry that things won't return to the way they were before the argument, combined with trying to be patient enough that things recover over time in their own right, and if they are still upset with me. (Which if they were upset with me, why speak to me and include me in playing Among Us for a full night, or allowing me to be on her telegram and discord?)

To compound the fact, their father and step mom got diagnosed with Covid. And I am struggling on exactly how to help them as they had asked to not be flooded with DM's at the time, as they are still struggling to process it; plus the trouble of distance.

***TLDR***; I don't want to allow this mixture of worry to overcome me. I want to do a spell to protect me from this worry, and rebuild my friends trust in me by showing them I respect and listen to their requests.",spells

Honey Jar and Sour Jar simultaneously?,17,iswinv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iswinv/honey_jar_and_sour_jar_simultaneously/,15,1600153913.0,"Hi Witches!‚ú®

Long short story, a month and something ago, I learnt that my LTR boyfriend cheated on me at the beginning of the year. ""Managed"" to get over his shit show until he let himself fall in love with a coworker and out of love with me because of his lies. I was ready to get over all of it, but a couple of days later he decided it was better for him and I to part ways (heroic right...). 2 weeks later he was with her after swearing he wasn‚Äôt leaving me for her.

Fast forward to now: I sadly still love him, but, I doubt it could be salvageable now that she is sleeping next to him and I am not sure I could get over that if he came back to me.

Still, I made two jars, a Honey directed to us and a sour to them. I am wondering if it is possible to manage both at the same time since he his on both spells?

If that‚Äôs any help, here‚Äôs what I used

The sour is: Vinegar, Chili flakes, mustard seeds, dog‚Äôs and cat‚Äôs hair, wild roses thorns, a pic of him, a printed pic of her and an item from him

The sweet is : Cinnamon, Honey, Vanilla beans, rose petal, wild roses leaves, bay leaves, lavender oil, dried flowers from a bouquet he gave me some years ago and an item of his.

In the end if we are not made to eachothers, I deeply wish his new found ""true love"" will wreck him in every ways for what I have been through because of his actions.",spells

Blood Magick for Healing Spell?,15,iscgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iscgpr/blood_magick_for_healing_spell/,5,1600080405.0,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to make this as brief as I can. My partner was recently diagnosed with having UVH (Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction). It's a bit rare compared to BVH, and we're pretty young. To break it down, UVH is when one ear stops communicating proper signals to the brain, which then compromises one's sense of balance. It basically feels like you're drunk all the time, but without any of the good feelings from it. At least that's how my partner puts it. It might be permanent, but it might go away on its own within several weeks. Currently what we're able to do is some physical therapy exercises to retrain the nerve to properly communicate with his brain.

However, I've been thinking about working a spell for my partner that may help the healing process, even if I can reduce the dizziness for him too. And that's why I wanted to know if its a good idea to use blood magick (a prick of the finger really) to amplify the healing spell. I will more than likely get a strand or two of his hair as well to make the spell as specific for him as I possibly can. 

I've never included blood magick in my spells before, because I know it's very powerful. I don't include certain things in my energy work unless I know I've done my research for it.

Thoughts? Have any of you ever done blood magick to help amplify a healing spell? How'd it turn out? I'd really appreciate some stories. Thanks in advance!",spells

She is very abusive to him, long story short they broke up he is willing to give her literally everything (even the house that he bought, he is giving her half the profit when they resell, like 30k) the only thing he wants in return is half custody of the baby. 
She's just going above and beyond telling lies talking about how he is it drunk and he can't be trusted with the baby, and she is in fear for her and her baby's life when they're around him and my family. (I have a big family and we have done nothing but accepted her and her family with love and open arms) Her mother and her family as well, starting all sorts of drama spreading lies etc. All these people are drug addicts, and associated with scary people that can put the baby in harm's way no questions asked. Granite my brother is no angel but he is not an abusive person and he is a wonderful father, he works his buns off, does whatever he can to make sure her and the baby are taken care of and then some. 
He's not a drunk, partying is last thing on his mind cuz all he cares about is coming home to his daughter like that is all he has to live for kind of a thing. I don't know, she doesn't care about what's fair for the baby she only cares about getting what she wants. I don't do magic that puts harm on other people, and I don't intend to. So I was wondering if anybody had something out there or some advice on stopping the lies and the gossip and  just overall do what's in the best favor for the child, because she is the most important. They are both great parents, they just weren't a good match for each other and the baby shouldn't have to suffer for that. 
They have a court case coming up for custody and all that, I just want her lies to be revealed in abundance so it doesn't affect the custody case. My brother has a very successful business and I feel like that's why she doesn't want him to have any custody so she could take full advantage of child support etc. It's very selfish and just disturbing. I have been surrounding her and her family with white light and just trying real hard to pull them out of that negative energy just black smoke that they're surrounding themselves with. I constantly put protection around my brother and have done much magic to help with his court cases etc. But I truly feel like I need to do something more, and it's also in a bit of short notice like everything's happening so fast.

I am very determined to be with my ex again, but recent social media activity (not his, that of a girl I suspect he is seeing yet cannot verify) has dented my confidence. I missed a chance to have someone cast a reconciliation spell for me tonight, and will have to wait till the end of September for the next opportunity. 

I am using a large mojo bag, which is placed on a high shelf at home. I have been taught to look in its direction and focus my wishes on it as I do. However, I find myself feeling nervous as I repeat in my mind affirmative statements about him and I.

I will also be casting a candle spell on Wednesday. The candle is said to burn for about 6 hours, and I have been told to focus all my wishing energy on it throughout the process. 

I really want this to work, and to learn some tips on being confident about a future outcome, so any advice would be very much appreciated.

Is it possible/safe to enchant an object that may already be enchanted?,17,ijiocb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ijiocb/is_it_possiblesafe_to_enchant_an_object_that_may/,4,1598844168.0,"My boyfriend has a lot of issues with mental health and self worth, so among other things I want to enchant something to help him improve. I'm not super experienced with magic but I find it works like a charm (pun unintended) when I use it in tandem with non-magical solutions. So the logical choice for enchanting would be his favorite necklace, which belonged to a close friend that passed away a few years ago. But she was a green witch, and this pendant looks like it was a sigil she might have made herself. I never got to meet her myself, but I asked if he thought enchanting it to help him would be something she would have wanted and he said yes. 

If more info on the possible purpose helps, the origins of the necklace is completely unknown, but if it had a spell my guess is it would be gardening or health based. Her health was always poor, doctors couldn't answer many of them. My boyfriend is the same way, and about once every couple years he suddenly gets hit with a new rare and disorder, but last year it was pretty tame by his standards. (Two episodes of stress induced paralysis. This is what he considers tame.) So if the sigil was health based there would be evidence to back it up, but if it's gardening based he probably overpowers it with his genuinely unnatural ability to kill any plant he touches.

So if this necklace had spells on it already, would there be any harm in another? Would having the second spell align with the original's intentions help? Thanks in advance!",spells
Trying remember a spell,10,ij9let,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ij9let/trying_remember_a_spell/,0,1598805554.0,"Okay so a couple of years ago I found this spell online and recently remembered about it and want to try to find it so if it sounds familiar or anyone knows please let me know.

You are meant to tie this string 3 times, and with each knot you were supposed to recite some spell.
It‚Äôs supposed to give the person of choice or who you hate terrible nightmares about the thing they fear most

Banishment help/tips,1,ij4oer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ij4oer/banishment_helptips/,1,1598781270.0,"Hi, I have a question about banishing someone in my life. The situation is a bit complicated to type out completely but the gist of it is my stepdad is a very toxic and controlling person, I think he is manipulative as well. He‚Äôs also verbally abusive and in some cases physical, but because my mother is still engaged to him (I believe once maybe 3 years ago she might have intended to break it off after an incident where he threatened to kill our cat at the time, had my sister start burying a hole and pushed her into a ground and had us in the car that night, unfortunately he somehow convinced her to stay)

 I find it tricky to get involved with child protective services or something similar, because he‚Äôd figure it out and it would turn nasty (my mother also overheard my sister mentioning it once and brought it up to him and it ended with him screaming a lot and saying things like ‚Äòif you think this is abuse then I will show you what abuse feels like‚Äô) 

Since the cat incident she also hasn‚Äôt gone against him much (such as walking away or yelling at him for something) and it seems whenever he does something she disagrees with she hardly ever says anything now and kind of laughs it off, and me and my sister are the most intimidated and feel unsafe, it‚Äôs been about five years and I really can‚Äôt stand his presence anymore and just want our family to be happy without him. I‚Äôve already consulted a kind root worker who‚Äôs already casted a banishment spell for me and gave them all the details I could, but I just wanted to know if there is anything more I could do say in the case the spell ended up not working, or even just added boosters. 

As much as I hate him, I don‚Äôt wish to harm him, so I‚Äôm not looking for anything that would cause curses or something to potentially harm someone in my family. 
I‚Äôve heard a bit of cayenne pepper and sage being being mixed counter clockwise in your hand and blowing it is one method, I also have a poppet. 
I‚Äôve heard of black salt being used for banishment as well, but I‚Äôm having a little trouble finding out exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do with it/how you can use it for banishment. 
But any tips in general would be really helpful. I‚Äôm inexperienced with the subject so if there is small things I can do, I would prefer that or a ‚Äòbeginner‚Äô level sort of work. I just really need help to get him out our life. 

Also, I‚Äôve considered my mother‚Äôs feelings before, but from what I‚Äôve experienced over these years I believe there is much more better for her, and she definitely deserves someone who isn‚Äôt so hateful, he‚Äôs been nasty and aggressive to her as well. I think she feels too intimidated to be able to really stand up to him, and she hasn‚Äôt in a while and always seems to give in or side with him even if she doesn‚Äôt want to. I just really want him to be out our life without having to feel scared of him when he‚Äôs around every day.",spells

Let the water rinse away the tough outer shell you have built through these survival mechanisms.  Let the water leave you bare, naked and vulnerable, cleansed of facade and receptive to change.

Dry off, but don‚Äôt apply any moisturizers/creams/after shower routine.  Find a nice place to be alone with a mirror, behind closed doors (full length mirror is best).  Dim the lights and work by candlelight if that best sets the tone.

Cast a circle/sacred space/raise energy in the way that fits your tradition, but without using tools ‚Äî only your body, your mind, and your spiritual connections.

If you work with divine feminine or nurturing spirits, call on them at this time to work through you.

Place an oil, salve or cream that you use in your magical practice (the one tool) on the palms of your hands, rub them together slowly and open up the channel between you and your concept of the divine/spiritual mother.  Continue to work your hands until your hands are her hands and no longer your own.

Disrobe infront of the mirror, and have the courage to not look away.  Confront the parts of your body that unsettle you, scare you, or make you feel ashamed.  For each part, think about:

1) What is the nature of this feeling?

2) What are the thoughts that lead to it?

3) What external places do these thoughts come from?  Media, judgmental family members, societal norms or pressures?

Remember: your hands are now HER hands.  She is with you.  Use your hands to comfort you in the way a mother would.  If things get too intense, turn away from the mirror and re-center your mind on her presence before returning to the mirror. 

On the part of your body that you are focusing on, rub the oil into your skin, with gentle and loving motions like a mother figure would.  Call upon your nurturing spirits or divine feminine to act through your hands to bless this part of you and to remind you that it is holy, beautiful and powerful.  Trace your sacred symbols with your hands over this part, taking your time.

Apply more oil to the rest of your skin, like you would a moisturizer.  Replace the space left behind by removing your hard outer shell with the oil/salve as a renewing and protecting layer of the divine feminine.  Take a long time with this, giving extra attention where needed.

Conclude by paying extra attention on the area of your chest/heart (or where you feel the most tension).

Now, place your body in the positions of any divine poses you know, such as those depicted in statues of your tradition.  If you don‚Äôt know any, ask the divine feminine you work with to teach one to you, or create a pose that represents beauty, power, magic or motherhood.  In the mirror, realize the beauty that you have created with your own body.

At this time, do what you feel most compelled to ‚Äî close the circle, thank your spirits, journal about the experience, divine, craft, meditate more deeply on the thoughts/feelings that arose, do something that makes you feel powerful, sleep, have an ugly cry, watch the AOC makeup video ‚Äî all are valid!

Over the next few days, take some time to research depictions &amp; descriptions of divine, spiritual, mythological women through history and across cultures, such as:

Creepy stuff appearing,5,ienjy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ienjy0/creepy_stuff_appearing/,4,1598149309.0,"every time I turn around and just normally I see things. There are a few ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù that appear regularly One is a nearly fully clothed in black fabric that looks like bandages with three fingered hands that looks either burned or severely cut. The face is carved out, with dried blood seen and the cloth covering the top of its head. It has on three occasions rotated it‚Äôs head so it‚Äôs chin is facing the sky and I see him under beds and through the edges of doors. He is also maybe 4‚Äô9 although I‚Äôve seen him as tall as my door maybe 6‚Äô0 and his elbows are like knees and he scuttles all over my walls he appears the second most

There is one with a yellow cardigan, maybe 7‚Äô0, wearing what I think is blue jeans and a bowl hair cut, I only see blues as he runs past or as I turn I think he has a partially wrinkly face, maybe 50 and a massive smile yet I know his hair is strictly black, I often see him whilst in cars or other transport. He is there pretty much every car drive and occasionally walking a shaggy dog


There is also a 5‚Äô5 ish woman in a flowery bride dress with her veil thingy torn. She has stark blue eyes and jet black hair. She has one of those really strong jaw lines. Sometimes I see her but her face and hands are withered and grey and her eyes look like the ones blind people have. She always appears in mirrors late at night in the dark. She is in mirrors and other reflective surfaces.


And there is also a man with a sort of Indiana Jones hat, long sleeves of what I assume is a suit and smart trousers and black shoes. It‚Äôs hard to make him out because he is totally black, he is opaque and black everywhere, like the void. He is maybe a little shorter than the woman. He can also be in other shapes, like a fat man, and I giant hairy thing with massive arms. He always appears at night, seen through pretty much everywhere the other spooky things have been mentioned, the corner of my eye, door cracks mirrors and once lying on the bed next to me, looking right at me, to which I promptly turned the lights on and he disappeard. He has twice shown his only non black feature, his teeth. Once through a door crack looking at me sideways with his mouth smiling with literal sharpened triangle teeth with his mouth stretched too wide, the second time when he was lying next to me.
I see him a lot
He is pure evil to the core and I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling he is always watching, waiting for be to let my guard down. Something about him just seems purely demonic in every way I can think of. I have terrible nightmares about him where whenever i speak or ask anything or even move towards him he opens his mouth, revealing fire inside of him. I don‚Äôt know if he is laughing, taunting or just explaining he wants to watch the world burn. 

There are many other dark things I have no physical image of but I feel them there.


If anyone can identify what these are or interpret them please go ahead, there are many  more things I hear, sense or smell and I feel like there is always something after me",spells

So Carla and I have been friends for about a year. We were that ‚Äòwill they won‚Äôt they‚Äô sapphic pair who are too awkward or scared to admit their feelings. We kinda started talking about dating but it eventually got nowhere and we had to walk away from whatever it was. 

Months later I made a protective spell jar on Carla‚Äôs request, and being a baby witch I just put in  additional components that I liked the meaning of without thinking it through. 

I added salt, eggshell,  basil, chamomile, tumeric and black pepper. I ALSO added red rosebuds and a forget-me-not. 

I also made an identical bottle for myself at the same time. 

Now, since seeing her in person since giving it to her, there is this massive energy between us. We keep being dragged to each other and every interaction feels like it carries more weight somehow.

I need help creating a Binding/Freezing spell for a thief who is planning on coming back to steal again.,9,idjg7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/idjg7x/i_need_help_creating_a_bindingfreezing_spell_for/,3,1597988142.0,"*edit* I am not interested in or able to pay someone to cast this spell for me. I am only looking for advice. 

This morning I woke up to find that my spare car key had been stolen. I don't want to go into details, but I think they are probably planning on coming back to steal my car, bc why else would they steal the keys? I have done all there is to do in the mundane, police are useless, as usual. 

In my head, I'm thinking of creating a three part spell/ritual,
- to make the key uncomfortable for them to touch (my initial thought is make a clay or wooden key and put in a fire, while chanting something like their guilt will burn as hot as the flames every time they touch it.)
- to disable the key (maybe smashing the key after it has been in the fire, while saying something like this will only work for the rightful owner) 
- and finally something to bind them from stealing again. I don't know who this person is, if it is one person or a group of people working together (there were several items stolen from other people in the area), so I don't know if it would be suitable for a spell where I'd normally write someone's name on a piece of paper. I thought about making a genderless clay figurine, and touching it's hands to all the surfaces this person would have had to have touched, and then tying their hands behind their back, while saying something about hands that were not welcome will be bound or something like that, and then freezing the figure (or burning it as well, to symbolise their conscience burning them too bad to steal again) 

Clearly, I need help with the wording of things. I also am drawn to color and candle magic, so whatever color associations you feel would be appropriate here would be helpful.

Spell Jar Help,2,iarevn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iarevn/spell_jar_help/,6,1597609222.0,"For the last two years I have worked on a sour jar, and followed the directions to the letter while making it. It has been sitting behind my toilet since 2018. I haven't seen any results despite working on it and shaking the jar every Tuesday (Mars, war, fighting,ect.) I decided earlier this year to take a brake from spell work mostly due to the COVID effecting the way I get my supplies and how readily I can get them.

I have returned to shaking the Jar again, and I am starting to become frustrated and perhaps a bit worried that something isn't working as I haven't been seeing any results. As the target is long distance and I communicate with them over the computer, there isn't much I can see, but they seem okay despite the situation that I am trying to get them out of.

I wonder what else I can do. The couple choices I have is to put the jar in my freezer and see if that will do anything, or take the jar and bash it at a cross roads, releasing all the energy that I had in the jar and guide it to the intended target.

From foraging to cooking, all these arts go into this spell and will help create harmony, peace and love in your home, wherever and whoever you are. 

It is basically a compote which when you serve to your loved ones/housemates it will create the harmony that you desire.  Take 1kg of wild damsons, 400g sugar, a splash of moon water (120ml or so) and a single chopped lavender flower. Boil together for ten minutes.  When stirring your wooden spoon becomes your wand, and this is when you stir your intent into the spell.  Have a look at this:    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXkFVyG2zjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXkFVyG2zjk) and it will show this all clearly.

It is such a fascinating subject that i thought I would give you a little synopsis...

Wicker Man festivals have been given a bad rap by a) Julius Ceasar and b) The 1970s horror film of the same name. And I wanted to redress the balance somewhat by sharing my thoughts here. 

A wicker man was created by bending green willow branches into the shape of a man.  The shaping of willow into various forms is a well known tradition of the UK and is especially prevalent in the South West of the country (the Somerset levels is where willow grows abundantly).  All sorts of creations are made from dragons to chickens.

There is scant evidence of human sacrifice performed by druids and witches within a wicker man.  The main proposer of this method was Julius Caesar himself whilst writiing about his conquest of Gaul (remember your Asterix?) He wanted to discredit the ‚Äòpriests‚Äô (i.e. the druids) of Gaul so there was good reason for him to say they sacrificed humans.

It was most likely that the sacrifice was the wicker man itself (the use of the word man fuelling the rumours of human sacrifice), sometimes they would contain dead animals who would then be cooked in the flames and eaten at the feast afterwards.  Their blood having been spilt and poured in libation before they were placed inside.  

Human sacrifice does not appear to be part of the Druidic rituals, although we cannot say for sure either way, as it was an oral tradition, but there does not appear to be an echo in todays practices and country traditions - which is something that you would expect from such a main stream religion of old.  There are certainly other echoes (maypole dancing for example).  Do check out my video on YT for more information at: [https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8](https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8) Which has the added bonus of a Make a Mint Money Charm (get some quick cash)

That is not to say that there were not sects who did sacrifice their fellow man - but it is unlikely that this was main stream (I mean would you follow such a sect where the next victim might be you?).",spells

Spooky Graveyard Dirt,12,i3pkau,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i3pkau/spooky_graveyard_dirt/,6,1596596951.0,"Question About Graveyard Dirt:

My friend brought me some graveyard dirt from Stull Cemetery recently. After doing some research on the place, in addition to the dark and foreboding energy I felt as soon as I touched it, I‚Äôve decided that this soil is evil and I‚Äôm not sure what to do with it. She claimed that she had left the spirits as offering in exchange for the dirt but also says she has paid penance for taking it. And I‚Äôm really not trying to fuck with spirits like that. 
I never use magic to harm others, only to make my life easier and more interesting. So I can‚Äôt imagine using this soil on anyone in particular. But I‚Äôm not sure what to use it for. And I don‚Äôt want the spirits to escape it. Right now I have it bound by a sigil, hemp cord, and it is grounded by a large piece of hematite in a box with an eye on it. I‚Äôm considering sealing it in candle wax. I‚Äôm also seriously thinking about driving to Kansas just to return the dirt to where it belongs. 
What do you think? Could I use it for a magical purpose that will not cause harm or release evil entities? Should I seal it further, then use it for one spell in particular and then rid my hands of it? Or should I return it?",spells

Influencing a change in my bosses mind for the better?,2,i310sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i310sf/influencing_a_change_in_my_bosses_mind_for_the/,1,1596503558.0,"Hi r/spells. I‚Äôm in a predicament at my workplace, and considering the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do about this situation.

In a nutshell, my boss and president of the company I work for will not let anyone work from home full time, or at least temporarily, even during this Covid crisis. I‚Äôve talked to him about this prior to the outbreak, and my only choices are : be furloughed and he looks for another person to fill my place, or work as a freelancer at reduced pay with no benefits and considered less of an asset. Not to mention I honestly thought working a few days a week full time from home would be a part of my job, and one of the reasons why I accepted it. This would benefit many people, not just me. 
My job is mostly done on the computer and very mentally taxing.
My company is a small company and considered essential. My boss is an older person and traditional in his thinking, and quite frankly behind the times when it comes to workflow. There will hopefully be a change in company ownership by the end of this year and considering who my superior is, my only hope is that maybe this will be possible after the change. 

This company is way out in the country, and the commute sometimes sucks. I‚Äôm not the only person who would rather not commute and some of these like-minded people are a part of the family owned business, but what my boss says always goes.

My problem is...how do I go about influencing this change that would help all of us? I‚Äôve talked to him multiple times about it and it‚Äôs like beating a dead horse. I was given advice before the pandemic that it may be better to wait and ask him about working from home after the season‚Äôs big project is finished, but the pandemic changed the path of my prior plan. I‚Äôm stuck in this job because my family could really use the money and I‚Äôm lucky to have it because I‚Äôm entry level. This issue has been digging into me like a rusty nail and caused me great dislike for the workplace and my boss for some time, especially with the crisis. We all need a positive change.

I know that karma dictates that they will get what's coming to them, but is there something that could open their eyes, because in this specific instance, they refuse to acknowledge that what they did was completely wrong, cost me a lot of money and stress, and almost caused all of us to be homeless. 

(Long story short, they lied about getting jobs to pay rent and then waited the day rent was due to tell me and my other roommate, as we were going to talk to our landlords about the fact that the house all of us were living in was uninhabitable. They then blamed us, their parents, the landlords, the world being unfair, when they ultimately got evicted and me and my other roommate got out due to the uninhabitability. Yes that's the short of it, and doesn't include all of the emotional abuse and gaslighting they put me and my other roommate through.)

It just feels as if they will never know the full extent of the pain they caused when they refuse to even acknowledge that they dug their own graves and threw themselves in, and then wondered why they were in the hole and blamed it on everyone around them. I have tried to explain it to them, but they refuse to acknowledge it or own any of their part in it.

I dont want to curse them, so much as help open their eyes to the vast amount of hurt they have caused. Does anyone know a spell for this?

I did a lot of research and read a lot of books, but with witchcraft you don‚Äôt really know what you‚Äôre dealing with. You really do get everything back threefold lmao.

I was around 17 or 18 when things started to get a little out of control, so I shut myself down and haven‚Äôt practiced since.

I‚Äôm (23F baby witch) pretty sure someone is either directly or indirectly sending bad vibes my way. I‚Äôm usually pretty lucky with not having bad things happen to me, I feel because I try to only put out good. 

Lately it‚Äôs been one bad thing after the next. 

1.) My hair has begun falling out, and despite going to get lab work that shows something is a little off, the dr‚Äôs office still hasn‚Äôt been able to find and read my results, despite the fact I walked the results in and handed them to the front desk 3 weeks ago

2.) just got 4 new tires and one is randomly going flat 

3.) Work has never been more stressful and every little project I work on goes sour one way or another 

4.) My relationship with my bf is very blah and strained recently because of work hours 

5.) I‚Äôm stuck in covid quarantine because my friend (who I guess isn‚Äôt a good friend?) didn‚Äôt tell me she knew she was in contact with someone who knew they were positive, both of which are still going about their life. 

So idk if this could all be chalked up to bad luck and hard times, or if someone is sending bad vibes my way. I feel like my group of friends and co workers get frustrated with me because like I said things usually go my way (I.e good relationship with no cheating or fights, got a raise at work, I live at home with my parents so I don‚Äôt have to pay a ton of bills & and have a good family life so I enjoy living at home). Last thing I almost forgot to mention that may be the reason my hair is falling out is I currently have an alter for Aphrodite that I don‚Äôt tend to everyday.",spells

I recently nabbed a gorgeous [Body Candle](https://shopemone.com/products/naked-torso-candle) and am interested in devising a beauty spell. Not a temporary glamour spell, but a long-lasting beauty spell - one which will promote permanent and gradual changes and help me in bringing about the vision I have for myself. I personally have yet to come across any such spells and I know others may be interested in something like this as well. As such, I figured I could ask for some help to come up with a successful spell/ritual which others can use as well.

So far, all I can think of in my limited experience is to carve my name into the candle and burn it (can't decide if over some days or all at once) during the waxing phase (the growing moon symbolic for growing allure) whilst meditating on my intent and visualizing my ideal self. Perhaps I could write a standard petition and place it under the candle as well. These seem like basic and sufficient ideas enough, but I am eager to know if anyone here may have any suggestions to increase the spell's potency or turn it into a full-fledged ritual by incorporating other aspects and ideas to make it even more personalized. I would appreciate any and all advice.

Much thanks!

Other people‚Äôs BOS all seem to be beautiful with amazing illustrations and art work throughout. Mine is a desperate scrawl with crossings out and coffee stains. However it does contain all the spells that I have done in the last five years, all the spirits that I have talked to and all the nature spirits that I have communed with. So as a grimoire it really stacks up.  I reference it every day whilst continuing on my path.

Did you know that the BIBLE is the best known grimoire, containing magic, rituals, invocations and incantations (or prayers as they are known) I do shudder when thinking of the pain that Christianity caused by saying that a witches grimoire meant being burnt at the stake as opposed to their own bible grimoire.

If you would like to know a little more about this do look at my youtube video [https://youtu.be/936--u3KB3w](https://youtu.be/936--u3KB3w) where I show you my current BOS and how I am going to dedicate my new BOS (to my children to grant them health and happiness throughout their lives) and how this will become a part of the book itself. The spells that I will cast using this new BOS await its pristine pages, but I do know that they will be magic.",spells

i'm curious to know if anyone has any spells related to this that they could share. a generic self love spell may work, however i feel the problem is more deeply rooted than that. it's feeling not good enough...unattractive and undesirable. for context, the girl is someone my current girlfriend used to have a crush on, so i guess thats where it stems from, however none of her exes or other prior flings have caused such terrible feelings for me. 

please help me, i'm desperate to feel better and relax myself. i become nauseous whenever i'm reminded of this girl. i have felt so ugly whenever i see myself. i feel like i'm withering away and its for no ""real"" reason. thank you in advance, i hope you can sense my vulnerability in this post lol. sending love xoxoxoxo",spells

Opening the Third Eye Spell,32,hsbti8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hsbti8/opening_the_third_eye_spell/,5,1594942724.0,"There is so much written about the third eye, i do not know whether it is right or it is wrong as I can only tell you of my experience in opening it.  The first time, i looked up on the net and saw that you should do deep meditation for this, i was instantly dispirited as I have the attention span of a goldfish and am simply unable to meditate for any length of time.

However my guide told me that I should cast a circle first of all.  There are two reasons for this, the first is for protection and safety as when you are psychically open you are psychically vulnerable.   The second is so the circle can magnify your power and ability.  

Like a good trainee I did as I was told, I cast the circle and then sat in it comfortably and gently massaged the third eye area on my forehead.  Then I opened my mind to feel any emotions that were coming in.  I also noted how my eyesight was behaving as I kept on seeing a fuzziness in the air, like a heat haze, which shimmered and glimmered around a certain area.  The fuzziness in the air turned out to be a spirit, my spirit guide in fact and he at that time told me that should I choose to open my mind to the occult, I cannot ever properly close it, i can tune out of it, but never shut it off.  He asked me if I was willing to carry on, and being young I said, without hesitation, yes.  

If he asked me the same question now, I am not sure what I would do, There is great things that came from realising my pyschic side, the mediumship, the wonder, the magic and the awe at the world.  However I have now encountered many many less salubrious forms and having to deal with those is scary, anger making, difficult, tiring and emotionally draining. Am I happier for it?  On the whole I think yes.  Or at least more resigned.

I'm very selective about what I send out into the Universe and my reasons for doing it. Now that we have that out of the way lol. My boyfriend asked me for the first time if I could work a healing spell for a friend of his (Jason) for his parents.. They're not super close though.

Long story short, they both have Covid. Both of them had to go to the hospital. The father is healing slowly, and the mother had to be sent back to the hospital from having a relapse of it... 

From what my partner has told me about them, they're all Christian. But they're good Christians, not the kind that shove their religion down your throat (I speak from experience of that). Good people. They're the type of people where if they were to receive an extra penny in change, they'll give it right back to you... 

Question is, do I really need consent to cast a healing spell on them? I did explain to my boyfriend that I would prefer to obtain consent than to just do it because energy work can have unpredictable outcomes even if you do everything right. Ask me how I know... I once made my own combination of a binding & truth spell on a family member. Boy did that give me more than I wanted... But it worked very quickly, I'm talking less than 24 hours quick. I got what I needed to hear though..

The tricky part is the parents of Jason are religious, but this is a serious situation for all involved, not just one but two of his parents are being harmed by this virus right now. You would assume he would say yes immediately if asked for consent at this point right?

UPDATE: Meg, one of the organizers, responded to my email. For questions about confidentiality she said to refer to the FAQ at the beginning of the survey. Also, any feedback that you all have should be sent to info@witchwithme.com. She also writes that the survey is purely voluntary and is not a scientific study (it for fun).

Because reasons. It took around a week or so for me to see the results. From that point on, it's up to you to continue with what the honey jar spell has started. For me, I did not continue with what the spell made after disposing of the contents.

The second time I did it, kinda manifested around the same time as the first one. I won't dispose of it yet and see how far it will take me. I'm still kinda waiting for something else to happen that's why.

So here's what I did, I lit a red candle(you can use pink or both candles) then wrote a petition. The petition is written in the present tense. No wishing, just wrote things that I want to happen in the present tense. Like ""love is always with me"". Folded it up, added some of the candle wax on the paper to ""seal"" it  and placed it in the glass jar. Filled it with honey, cinnamon powder and brown sugar. On top of the lid, I placed the lit candle(or both if you used 2) and let it burn. While it is burning, I stared at the flame and kept my heart and mind focused on what I want. Place it somewhere only you can touch and see it so that you can put your energy to it everytime.

Here are some other stuff that you can add too. These are optional which I believe will strengthen the spell. You can add photos, write runes across the petition and put other herbs(herbs/plants that represent love). You can also make your own chant/prayer while holding the jar to add energy to it. Do it as frequent as you can and have love in your heart while doing it.

The best thing is that you believe that it will work. Don't let your feelings of love falter. It may take some more time for others or it may take less. You'll see or feel the results. For me, before the events happened, I felt very uneasy like I'm super anxious and nervous. Then after a few hours, it happened. Not gonna say what, but something happened that involves the spell.

Anyway, I believe any honey jar spell will work as long as your intentions and belief on it is strong and it will manifest. Good luck to all of you and I hope this helps you too. I wish you all the best.",spells

Hello everyone! 

Like pretty much everyone else in the world, my SO and I have really been struggling through this pandemic. He already has clinical anxiety and depression (which is being treated medically) but the pandemic has really made things even worse. He has made it very clear that he is not unhappy with me or our relationship, but that he is just miserable in general. He hates his job, his boss, and his co-workers,(poorly run company not taking care of their employees during the pandemic) and while home is not something he hates, he is so miserable that the few hours he is at home don't really provide him with relief or the ability to relax, and every company in our area is on a hiring freeze until the pandemic is over. Our relationship has suffered because of this, bc he is almost always on edge, and he has no energy or motivation to engage. He spends most evenings on reddit (not this forum though!) before collapsing in bed, where he doesn't sleep well at all. 

I was thinking about maybe doing a honey jar to sweeten his thoughts of me and his thoughts of home. So that home is a place he doesn't have the weight of everything pressing on him, and that thinking of me/home brings him comfort during his day. 

I thought about including a cord with 7 knots, a rose quartz, some of his hair, some of my hair, and then also the paper with the spell on it. Are there any other ingredients you'd recommend? I'm not really sure what to write on the paper, on the part where I write my intention over and over without lifting the pen. I'm looking for some combination of the following

 ""Our home is a place of love and joy"" 

""Your struggles fall away in our home"" 

""Our home and our relationship brings you comfort and joy"". 

Other spell/magical suggestions are most welcome,
Maybe something I could sprinkle around our doors so that when he crosses the threshold he feels relaxed?

This spell will also ensure that your chosen crush will cross your path, thus ensuring they will notice you further.  

The only problem may be that there will be a lot of other people finding you attractive and desirable,  so be prepared to beat them off!  You can view full instructions here [https://youtu.be/hRwwMsQWCII](https://youtu.be/hRwwMsQWCII)  Or read on below for a short version.

Take equal quantities of meadow sweet, honeysuckle and rose petals and cover them with a plain vegetable oil.  Using your wand, circle above the pot of petals and say

‚ÄùI ask the flowers to place their intent within this oil, to ensure that I cross paths with my soulmate, and meet my lover, whilst being heightened in beauty and spirit‚Äô.

Place the pot in a cupboard for 3 days and then before you go out on the town, dab one spot above each eye and one underneath.  Et Voila!",spells

For the past 20 years I have struggled with a hormonal imbalance called PCOS. The symptoms are difficulty getting pregnant, irregular and heavy periods, weight gain, and abnormal hair growth.

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about spells for balancing hormonal issues (maybe involving a scale), spells invoking feminine dieties to counteract the masculine side effects, a spell for weight control or healing in general, or fertility in general. Really anything you think of that could be useful would be welcome.

Sex Drive Spell,50,he66gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/he66gw/sex_drive_spell/,4,1592908027.0,"Baby witch here, so bear with me!

I've been having trouble getting in the mood with my partner. I'm not sure why - I'm VERY happy with my partner, who is so so understanding when I'm just not feeling it and when we DO have sex, it's incredible so I'm not sure why I don't want it ALL THE TIME. But, be it stress or lack of confidence or what have you, I rarely feel sexual at all.

So, as with most things since I've begun practicing, I got witchy with it!

Keep in mind: this is what works for ME. Everyone is different and you have to find your own power and your own way! But this works WONDERS for me personally.

All you need is:
2 candles (1 red, 1 white)
Essential oils for anointing (I used lavender, rosemary, red grapefruit, and rose - romantic scents, but feel free to substitute with what you like personally!)
A shower!

So I rub both candles down with the oil while whispering my intentions (""I am sexual. I am sensual. I am passionate."") Then with oil still on my fingers, I draw a line down my chest. Then I lit both candles and let them burn while I got into a hot shower.
While in the shower, I imagine all of my insecurities being washed away. I picture them swirling down the drain as I clean myself and breathe in the smell from the oils and the candles. I still put forth my intentions - ""I am a goddess. I am powerful. I am beautiful.""
Once out of the shower: I blow out both candles, pour the wax from the red candle onto the white candle, relight the white candle, and let it burn in the bedroom until...you know...afterwards!

I hope this helps anyone who has the same frustrations. It really was a game changer for me! Good luck!",spells

About a year and a half ago terrible things started happening to me and my partner. We have friends into the occult and it seems these bad things happen around then or after seeing them. I got an awful job that caused serious mental harm no matter how hard I tried. My favorite necklace went missing after said friend complimented it. My partner ended up breaking a bone and having a terrible experience at the hospital, my cat died a few weeks after they stayed with us. I got diagnosed with a somewhat rare disease that‚Äôs done awful things to my body. I had a terrible trip on drugs and the first person I felt like I had to call was those same friends vs other friends that are closer to me.

Litha sun energy talisman,18,hctr9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hctr9r/litha_sun_energy_talisman/,0,1592715881.0,"Today I celebrated my first Litha as officially pagan. I wanted to make or do something special and decided I wanted to make my self a talisman to contain solar energy. Sharing is caring so I thought I'd post what I did here incase anyone finds it useful.

For background, I have depression & anxiety. I find it gets worse in the winter due to the lack of sunlight. My intent for this talisman was to capture or soak up the midsummer solar energy into an object that I can then tap into in the darker months if I find I'm struggling.

I used a bipoint sunstone crystal with one end larger than the other, orange jewelry wire and some wax. I left the sunstone and wire out from just after dawn until sunset in full sunlight to soak up as much energy as possible. 

At sunset, I lit a candle and incense and used the wire to fashion a net or cage tight around the crystal to contain and support it. I started at the bottom, ensuring the lower, larger point was accessible and wove up to the thinner point. Whilst I did this I meditated and visualised solar energy as a golden, glowing liquid flowing into the top of the crystal like water into a vase. Once I visualised it as full, I mentally and physically sealed it by winding the wire into a clasp (so I can hang it round my neck if needed) and placed hot wax from the candle around the top of the crystal and cage. I then keep it in my hands until my incense stopped burning and said ""So mote it be.""

I'm really pleased with how it came out. It's currently sitting on my altar for inspection by the ethereal beings that visit and then I will seal it away safely until winter. I plan to access the energy by pressing the base point against my skin and meditating on it.",spells

My dad has been toxic for as long as I can remember. He has caused my sister, my mom, and I a great deal of frustration and emotional hurt and trauma over the years.

My parents divorced when I was in 4th or 5th grade and I still live with my mom. Due to me not being able to have my own insurance (currently unemployed and my job didn‚Äôt offer the best insurance) I still have to remain in contact with him just to please him and remain on his insurance plan.

He doesn‚Äôt contact me a lot but he is aware of the fact that I‚Äôm still a college student. Many college students, such as my mom‚Äôs fianc√©‚Äôs children, don‚Äôt talk to their parents due to being busy at college. My dad doesn‚Äôt understand that.

He gets very angry when I don‚Äôt call or send a small message, blows things out of proportion, etc. (I can provide more examples if needed) I don‚Äôt know how to say this lightly but I really wish my dad wasn‚Äôt around. He causes too much emotional distress for me than what it‚Äôs worth.


My question: 

With that said, I still need to have a form of contact to stay on his insurance a little longer but I want him out of my life for the most part. Is there a spell I could perform to cut this toxic family member out of my life? I‚Äôm sick of being emotionally drained by him..he has never once given me a burst of happy or good energy.

Midsummer Rituals,25,hbkip5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hbkip5/midsummer_rituals/,1,1592535227.0,"Every year at Midsummer witches gather around their bonfires.  This is one of the most ancient of festivals - possibly the one that was first ever observed by ancient man, and still has the same magick and pull today as it ever did.

Witches of the light (as to those who worship the Old One) would offer up thanks to the great Goddess of the sun, praising and thanking her for setting the sun on its annual path so that the seasons pass in their order.   Wiccans/Neo-Pagans know her as Litha but I have always known her by the ancient Anglo Saxon name of Fritha, guardian of the sun and one of the twelve great Earth Spirits. 

For further enlightenment on this years festival you could watch this short video [https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4](https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4) As a fourth generation witch - whilst growing up, I thought bonfires at dawn, halloween rituals and Yule logs a plenty was perfectly normal, just part of our yearly celebration.  It is only with age comes hindsight!

Because each midsummer falls at a slightly different time, there are different spells that come to pass due to the alignment of the stars.  Midsummer‚Äôs eve falls on the 19th June with the sun reaching its ‚Äòstopping point‚Äô at 1.04pm (UK time - and in Devon) on the 20th June.  So this year it proceeds the suns move into Cancer, which has considerations for the hearth, happiness and the home.  A spell therefore at Midsummer asking Fritha to bless the hearth and home with happiness, will slowly build until its fruition on 30th December 2020 - the suns next show in Cancer.",spells

Is it true for benefits you gain from spell you often take something away from another person?,3,h9s8kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h9s8kg/is_it_true_for_benefits_you_gain_from_spell_you/,2,1592294923.0,"I was told by a veteran witch to be careful about spellcasting because every benefit you get be it gaining a suitcase of luggage or having sex with a gorgeous girl and gaining physical strength all come from somewhere else (often indirectly stealing from another person). For example if you cast a money spell and found $50 on the ground in the next day............. That $50 was probably lost by someone while he or she was traveling. It didn't just pop out of thin air. For all we know  the person was a girl who needed that cash to get  taxi fare home. Because she somehow lost that 50 bucks as a result of the spell, she had to travel home. She could have been grabbed from behind, dragged to the bushes, and raped. Or she could have slipped and fallen on broken glass and hurt. If nothing dangerous happens at all, she still has to walk home. Maybe she gets lucky after she realizes she has no fare when she attempts to call for a nearby Taxi in traffic but her brother happens to also be in the same traffic line and sees her and calls on her to just join him and save cash. Whatever the results, she still lost $50.

A more worldly example can be seen by a quote the witch sent me in the chatroom.

>If I see a gorgeous girl on a street corner, and want to go do some kind of work to cause her to run over and sleep with me, the butterfly effect is in play. Let's say she does immediately run over to me.

>Let's say there is a man driving a car through the intersection who normally would have slowed to look at the girl, but since I tilted the machine, she isn't there. The guy coming the other way that runs the red light would have missed this man if she were there, but since she isn't, there is a horrific, T-bone wreck. The car rolls. It badly injures both drivers, and brutally kills an innocent 4 year old girl right in front of her mother, just for being on the sidewalk.

>How much of that is my fault? I didn't run the red light, I didn't tell the mother and daughter to go for a walk... The LHP answer is it wouldn't be my fault, because everyone is just doing their thing and shit happens. My answer is a good chunk is my fault. I didn't run the red light, but I tilted the fucking machine because I knew how and just wanted something for myself, and most people are stuck just playing with the 2 bottom paddles. If I hadn't done that, there would be no accident. I also know what I am doing, I know tilting the machine is unfairly slanting things in my favor, and that makes a higher standard apply to me. I know what I am doing and I know better.

BTW the witch is actually female but she was using the above example to me since I'm a guy to help me understand better how an innocent spell like finding a friend with benefits can have devastating consequences lol!

But still is what she warns against a legitimate part of sorcery and a basic functioning of spellcasting? For example if I'm having bad health issues because of old age and cast a spell and a week later I somehow regain my youthful athleticism, was that bodybuilder energy taken from someone else,probably a young guy in the military? As a result he fails PT and gets discharged, meaning he loses his house and his family suffers as a result with his kids starving and homeless?

I am very curious and her warning is why I am hesitate to do spellcasting right now! How true is her statement?",spells

Shortly after we broke up he entered a very toxic and abusive relationship that carried on for two years up until recently in, I want to say, very early March.

&#x200B;

Him and I, after not being able to contact each other for two years due to her, start to talk to each other out of the blue either March 12th or 14th. We decide to meet up in person and we have a full in-depth conversation about everything and we both still admit that we love each other.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this weekend we've been maintaining a ""friends with benefits"" sort of dynamic despite me really wanting to try something with him again. We still tell each other we love each other, perform intimate acts, etc. However, he wants to remain single for a while due to the trauma he faced. Totally understandable.

&#x200B;

With that being said, I had asked if he would ever want to try again and he said he wasn't sure right now but he's hopeful. Is there a spell I could perform that helps aid/speed up the healing process for him emotionally and mentally all while having him turn to me and be with me?

Step 1: Ensure that you have cleared all negative energy from your pendulum.  If you are unsure how to do this, then the best start is to wash your pendulum in spring water, dry with cotton.  Place in the sun to heal for an hour, then carry about your person for a further couple of hours to align with your own energy.

Step 2: Place yourself in a room free from drafts and  make sure that fans are off/windows closed

Step 3: Make sure you know what your yes/no swings are.  If in doubt ask questions where the answer is definitely a yes/no, i.e. Am I a cat? Do I have blue eyes? Then you can verify your yes no swing. 

Et Voila! You are now in a position to ask your questions - my latest trick is to find out if dogs are pregnant and how many puppies they will have.  

These, of course are the most basic of tips, for further in depth views watch my vid [https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg](https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg) which will give you a quick start guide in under 10 mins for the pendulum.",spells

He told me the opposite and that there's dark energy surrounding me when it comes to love life, my ex truly loves me, and that there's another girl involved and causing this mess (not true, but I believed it at first). Since I believed everything at first, I paid him to cast the negative energy away and for Vashikaran, which I didn't know was bad.  I realized that putting a love spell on the man I truly truly love was wrong, told my ex all about it, and asked the Pandit to stop the spell, even though he had already begun it the night before. Two days later he calls me saying he confirmed that he would stop doing the love spell. 

Fast forward to this past Saturday, I was casually on TikTok and saw a tarot video saying it was not on my ""fyp"" by mistake. They said similar things- there is a soul connection in my life and they truly love and want to be with me, but are afraid of committing.

This is unimportant to true knowledge. Your seeking a false relationship based on a controlling factor meaning you don't even like the person you just want to control them leading to they were never a fit for you and creating a bigger problem if it works due to them not even matching up with you.

Change my mind.

Also I'd prefer to see plant energy storage spells. Breaking curses. Making wards and shields for you dwelling. Spells for hiding your street from normal view. Spells for distancing yourself from people who will manipulate your view on your main focus or goal. These should be top priority here. 

Yet love and revenge is all I see. The most fruitless battle. Love creates revenge. Can't have love without hatred. 

I know this goes against rule one and I'll take it down if this truly gets to you guys but still I'm not staying silent anymore. Finding the proper knowledge or true skills to continue in this practice are hidden from the people who need the protection the most from those who seek destruction through mental abuse of forcing fake feelings upon someone who possible wouldn't even mix well in their potion of life.

I believe that it has now literally saved the lives of our family and pets. just imagine if the fire had taken hold at night without the ward spell protecting us. It doesn‚Äôt bear thinking about. I made a video showing the boundary lines and a slightly simpler ward spell which you can view [https://youtu.be/QgMSswcmq9w](https://youtu.be/QgMSswcmq9w)should you want to!

I would really love to know if you have made any ward / protection spells with any good results. For me it is one of the daily confirmations that magick works.",spells

A spell to help someone who has lost their way,2,gwx6k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwx6k5/a_spell_to_help_someone_who_has_lost_their_way/,0,1591357843.0,"[Cross Posted]

Hello All!

I have a close friend who has been dealing with a lot of pressure and difficulties lately. To deal with these stressors they have decided to run away from their responsibilities and hide in a religious lifestyle. I do not want to pressure them out of that decision. If that's their true path then that's what they need to do. But I worry that they are blinded to their reality and I want to help them be able to sort through their situation in a healthy way. I am a Green Witch, so I very much believe in addressing the root cause of problems, so I have tried my best to have those difficult conversations with them. However, it doesn't seem to be doing any good. I think this all stems from a lack of trust for other people and a fear that they are letting others down, so they are deciding to just give up and hide behind the lens of religion.

I want to do a spell that will help them recognize the totality of the world around them and give them the strength to sort through the issues that may be leading them to make these rash decisions so that they can find their true path -- whatever that may be. I really worry that they are going to follow through on decisions that will lead them to more destruction. I want to help them see the world with true sight; open eyes. I was hoping you lovely folks may have some suggestions on what to include in a spell of this nature.

Thank you!",spells
Seeking Guidance For Interpretation Of Flame,14,gwuksm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwuksm/seeking_guidance_for_interpretation_of_flame/,0,1591347998.0,"The intention of this post, is to gain insight from experienced practioners who have no ill motives, but only seek to share fact-based wisdom and knowledge. 

Non-consentual manipulation magick: the casting witch has no ill intentions to bring harm, chaos, or destruction to the target; the motive is selfish in nature. The target's identifying details were written on tissue paper, folded, sealed with casting witch's blood, pierced by a needle and unintentionally dropped just prior to entering the candle flame. In an effort to improvise, the needle was secured deeper into the hard wax, and a wooden tool was used to ignite the paper. The flames here initially high and steady. Shortly after, it became shorter and danced, but had two peaks, one on each end with a divot in the middle, showing slight resemblance of a heart. 20 hours later, the paper is still aflame, the candle wick has been drown in wax. The flame is short, small, blue/white, and very steady. The source of the flame doesn't appear to exist. Surely there must be a significant interpretation to this?

Am I cursed with Lycanthropy?,4,gwtvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwtvjp/am_i_cursed_with_lycanthropy/,15,1591345408.0,"Greetings, reddit. As you can see, my post is going to be a weird one, that's why I made a completely new reddit account, I never told anyone about what happens to me and there are close people that are checking my main reddit account and I don't want them to find about this yet. Also, English is not my native language so expect some spelling mistakes here and there. I have no idea who I can ask about this stuf honestly...

I never believed in paranormal stuff or curses but I can't ignore what's been happening for the past few years. I know I am not yet very convincing but hear me out, I am genuinely scared and paranoid. Every once in a while, I wake up in the morning really sweaty finding my blankets and pillows all thrown on the floor of my bedroom. I usually sleep naked but there were times when I didn't sleep naked and woke up with my tee either very enlarged (like when you try to pull the collar apart but you fail tearing your t-shirt) or torn.

Sometimes I even find food thrown away in random spots in my flat and the door of the fridge open and everything inside watery (I once had to buy another fridge as the old just stopped functioning properly). My neighbours that live in the same apartment block sometimes think that I am moving doing my workouts or dancing in the middle of the night as they can hear loud bumps coming from my flat (that only happens in the nights prior to these weird mornings) . I'm ashamed to say that sometimes I even find urine marks in the corners.

Another neighbour that is on the same level as me once threw a party in his flat and when people went past my door sometimes they would hear 'a dog growling but not barking' . When he told me that I couldn't control my emotions and I had a cringe-worthy reaction as I am usually a very anxious person and I can't just make up lies without shaking when I'm telling them, let alone when I am face to face with a person that I have to suddenly lie to. I just told him that I had to look after my girlfriend's dog in the end, but it was still weird and he didn't tell me anything about any growling since. (My girlfriend is studying in a different city, close to mine as we're both uni students and she's coming to my place from time to time).

But another old lady that is also my neighbour and leaves at the first level of my block said that the stray dogs from outside bark most of the night. (I know that they do that only or at least mostly when the episodes occur because I meet her in the mornings when I go to uni walking her dog and she always tells me to be careful because there can still be aggressive stray dogs around from last night).    I've considered that I might be sleep walking, but I've never been sleeping walking in my entire life and I never knew how I could check if I am.

I've considered having night-surveillance cameras, but there are multiple issues here: 1. My parents still buy stuff for me and that fridge was also expensive. They usually have to know what I need money for.                        2.  I could use my phone or just a regular old camera that can film, but they don't have a night-view mode and they can just run out of battery. I've got an iPhone and it's screen just locks automatically after a minute. Even if I disable that feature, iphones really run out of battery really fast, I tried filming for half an hour and its battery was dead afterwards.                       3. I am scared of what I would see. Even if it's just sleepwalking. I've seen other videos of that with people just talking in their beds with their eyes open and that was still creepy. Let alone me growling, pissing and doing all that mess when I never ever done that in my life (I casually asked my parents at one point if I used to sleepwalk when I was really young and they said that I didn't).

Obviously, I've seen a lot of stories/myths about lycanthropy and I was really creeped out. I am curious if you guys believe in such things. These episodes don't happen regularly (and yes, without exaggerating, they did happen on full-moon nights as well).

I am curious about your opinions. Am I way too paranoid? I've only anonymously asked a witch from my country about her opinion on my issue and she suggested I may be a werewolf and since then I'm paranoid and there's just anxiety everytime I try to sleep.

I tried making this post as easy to read so possible. Feel free to ask for more details. It's the weirdest thing in my life and I genuinely don't know who I can ask about this. Thank you for your time!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: I really appreciate your answers! I am still looking for more opinions before I make a decision regarding this issue. I'll be honest with myself and you guys.",spells

So I don't want to dump all my laundry in this post, but the story is that, when I was in high school, I had a boyfriend who I deeply adored. He was wonderful, so sweet and kind, my best friend and I loved him. The problem was, I'm aromantic (which means that I don't experience romantic attraction to anyone), although I didn't yet know it at the time. So I knew that I loved him, but it wasn't in the same way that he loved me. It started to cause friction between us, and I eventually had to break up with him. We graduated the next year and I haven't seen him since. It's been about five years and I still think about him a lot.

I carry around a lot of guilt and emotional baggage because of the whole situation. I miss him so much, but I also don't want to intrude on his life by seeking him out again because I know I hurt him, and what would be the point, anyway? It's not like we could just get back together, because I'm aromantic and he's not. He deserves someone who can love him the way he loved me.

I know spells aren't a cure-all, but I really hope there's something that might help, maybe even just to point me in the right direction to let go and heal. Can anyone help?",spells

She is a manipulative woman who wants everyone to be as miserable as she is, she will also bitch and moan that the store is never clean even though we do clean in fact I personally will get on the floor and scurb it. She is constantly mean to everyone including customers and the stores owners just pretend that she doesn't exist, I've tried to banish her but she came back 3 weeks later I've tried binding the negativity she has and that only seemed to work for a little while then she was worse then before it seems like nothing I'm doing is working and Im at my wit's end with this woman,she makes us all miserable and unfortunately for my coworker I am the only one who pratices magick and believes in its power so I'm hoping you guys will be able to help me out here",spells

My ex recently broke up with me because I was going through a lot in my life at the moment such as my mom being sick and starting a new job. Therefore, I was very distant with him and less affectionate. We'd only just started dating when all this occurred, so I didn't get to tell him how much these things were affecting me and why I was being so distant because he blocked me almost immediately after breaking up. But I'm in a much better place now, and I'm ready to start a relationship with him again.

So I'm looking for advice on how to cast a communication spell or something to get him to unblock me and open up to me and allow me to message him the situation I was in and why that was causing me to be so distant in hopes that he'll give me another chance. Thank you!!

By the way, if anyone is curious, I did try to go talk to him in person, but I did it on a day when I was feeling very sick due to a headache, and nothing came out right. Which is why I'd rather do it through text instead :)",spells
Get into medicine spell?,2,gofhkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gofhkx/get_into_medicine_spell/,4,1590164995.0,"I have a chance to get into medicine this year at a specific uni which does not require a test such as the ucat (mcat in the USA). (I'm from Australia), I have always wanted to be a doctor and I feel this is my chance. I have almost finished all of my prerequisites just maths left which is almost done.

This uni requires a high gpa ( at least 6.0 out of 7.0 to be competitive). I won't say my gpa but it is in that range. I have been trying for years and I want this year to be successful for me in terms of me getting into medicine at the specific uni.

I am looking for a spell with a combination of results, is this possible to do? For example, I need to finish my maths before July this year, find volunteering work as soon as possible (which is hard with coronavirus at the moment), get a medical interview this year for next years medical course, and be successful in the medical interview for me to get into 2021's medical course.

Is it possible to do such a spell which would result in all of these results? What do I need? Should I do a manifestation spell? Do I burn or bury it? Do I bury it to metaphorically ''make it grow into a tree''? Or do I do that only at the end of the spell once I achieve my goals. Do I have a to sacrifice something? I heard people sacrifice their fertility with blood magic because it is really strong magic, or make a deal with spirits that they will be riencarnated into their children.

Please give me as much information as you can, I have already done a petition paper spell, but want to do more spells to boost the spell. Also, with the intention spell, should I only burn/bury it  after it comes true or right now to send my intention out to the unverse?

Today I'm looking for a spell to protect another being from the influence of negative words. I don't know what to search to be able to find it, so I thought of asking here first.

The thing is, even though my bf is the sweetest person ever, he can't seem to have enough patience with one of our cats (the one who he feels the least affinity with, that ends up being the one that I feel the most affinity with), and at the first sign of she doing something wrong, he bursts into rage and start screaming with her, calling her idiot and so on.

I know that words have power and they can influence the wellbeing of another being in a biological level (there's a study with plants that were grown with compliments vs curse words/pejorative words/negative words. Surprise: the latter rotted and died in a matter of days.), so I'm looking for something to protect her from it.

Second time posting here. I don't know what to do. I have previous post about a spell i did on a specific person.

It was binding, and used blood also. I did the unbinding, this was like three months ago done. Everything went fine, life goes on smoothly, i don't even think of the person, he barely contacts me. Friendly talk two times over the past month, and thats it.

This man is taken, it is said in my previous post.

So now, three months after everything, unbind and all. Suddenly he contacts again, i am occupied with life, and other stuff, i don't have time for nonsense. In meantime i do delete his phone number, and block him on social media. What entered into me, what happened. I unblocked the guy, and i even dared to go so far to threaten him with exposing him what scum of person is he. 

He begs not to, rationally i understand, i don't want to ruin other peoples lives, but here comes this rage, anger hate pointed towards him. Its like i want what he took ftom me back, metaphorically speaking, i want my peace back, my life normal again.

I see that he doesnt care for noone beside himself, he steps on the dignity of others, and i want everyone to see that, that his nonchalant behaviour is exactly that, he doesn't care for noone beside saving his own skin. 

And i cant have that, and these pushing thoughts, like a compulsions, but aren't compulsions. Its pure hate.

From psychological point i can understand why i feel this way, but a year have passed by, and i am no longer with him, i dont even like him. On the opposite i dislike him.

Its simply all hate against him and his better half, more towards him. I want her to see what scum he is, i want everyone to see what a trash of person he is. He took part of me, i can't retrieve them. I cant even sleep from all this shifting energy of hate toward him. I want him to suffer at least half the way i do, and i was suffering. I want that more than anything.

I know that there will be judging toward me, believe me. There isn't a word that i havent said to my self, i even felt guilt, he didnt, confessed straightforward

I bear the guilt of his doings and mine too, the burden is hard, and there isn't a day that i don't judge myself because of going with that guy through that path.

When I see him now on posts with his family, the hate grows, more and more and more. I want him to suffer everyday, like i do. Or to retrieve to me my peace and to go to hell.

Thanks to anyone. Judgmental or no, i cant find the trye answer why i feel so much hate. I hate him with every inch of my soul.",spells

Need help changing a ritual!,1,gk5re5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gk5re5/need_help_changing_a_ritual/,6,1589562701.0,"A couple of months ago, long before Covid-19, due to a bad break-up and a practical semester I moved back to my parents house, which is several hours drive from my university. 
Due to medical reasons I often have trouble finding apartments in which I can live without getting more sick or being heavily limited in my day to day life. That's why I made a really elaborate ritual in which I enchanted a large quartz to hold and reinforce my intent to find a great apartment this summer. I meditated with and charged the crystal multiple times and by now I feel a large current of my intent swirling around it whenever I touch it. I tried to specify everything I need, down to in which time frame I needed to find a new place to live. Having a safe space to life is the most important thing for me to be able to complete my studies because the last time I moved cities to uni the first time, the first apartment I was in made my illness flare up so bad, that even now, nearly two years later I still am worse than before. That's why I poured so much energy in my spell, because finding such an apartment is essential for finishing my bachelor's degree (and later master's).

And that's where my problem lies: due to the same medical reasons I mentioned above I am at high risk and since everything uni related is online now I will not be moving back there anytime soon. And now I fear that since my needs are different now the spell won't do anything and it will be for nothing or that it even backfire somehow. So here's my question: can I chance or modify my spell without destroying/disrupting what I already made? What should I do?

TL,DR: I made a ritual to find an apartment in the summer, and now I won't move back to uni as planned.",spells

Sub Rule Clarifications,24,ga0jwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ga0jwh/sub_rule_clarifications/,0,1588153936.0,"Hello!

The forum rules have been updated.  The intention of the rules remain unchanged--to provide a safe and content-rich forum where people can knowledge-share about magick.  The wording of the rules was simply updated to improve clarity and communication.  

In particular, the old ""No off-topic"" rule was problematic--people who didn't read the pinned post or expand the off-topic rule to read the full text were unaware that advising mundane solutions rather than magickal solutions was prohibited.  When PMed, people overall were very apologetic, they simply didn't know.

To fix that, the rules have been rewritten so that the expectations around comments are visible above the fold, and a few other minor wording tweaks have been made.

Please avoid posting that you think someone shouldn't be doing magick.  That is explicitly prohibited on this forum; it isn't what people come here to read.  If you feel you absolutely must tell someone your opinion, you can always send a private message.

And please use the report function if you see someone violating a rule.  We don't ban people for first-time off-topic rule violations.  We simply remove the comments and PM them asking them to stop.

Thank you for helping to keep this sub a safe and content-rich forum!",spells

HELP! PROTECTION SPELL GONW WRONG,19,g2do29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/g2do29/help_protection_spell_gonw_wrong/,12,1587067551.0,"PROTECTION SPELL/RITUAL GONE WRONG.

I had a tarot reading with a spiritual reader. He not only reads tarot cards but he can feel energies and communicate with spirits. 

During my reading we discussed many things about my life which was pretty positive until I asked about a specific member of my childrens family. He told me that she had been doing witchcraft against me and he immediately said yes (i didn‚Äôt want to know what exactly just how to protect myself). This was obviously worrying but made sense as there had been somethings happening that I couldn‚Äôt explain before.


He told me in order to protect myself I needed to get a doll that resembled me, an amethyst crystal, rosemary and cut my nail or hair and put them all together in a small black drawstring bag. I would have to sleep with this bag under my pillow for seven days. On the seventh day I would need to bury it until a plant or something that would eventually grow roots under it which would form this protection. 

On the seventh day I went to bury it. But found myself in a situation. The place I had gone to bury it was in my community garden but I was not expecting anyone to be there as I‚Äôd gone in the night. There was a woman there that refused to let me be there as she believed I didn‚Äôt live there even though I did. A man then came to kick me out. He pushed me and the woman spat on me on top of many insults like hoping I would get coronavirus. It was terrible. I had not had an experience like this since I was child and it was a quite traumatic. I believe this was a spiritual attack. Why would this happen on a day I was supposed to finalise this protection spell? 

Anyways I left, found somewhere else to bury it and then went home. The next day it rained so I felt like it was a good sign, the plant was given something to help it grow over.

After two days I went back to where I‚Äôd buried it to check on it and I noticed a hole where the bag was. Someone had taken it. I cannot believe it. Who would do this? And why? Especially after seeing the contents surely they would just put it back? But no. It had completely disappeared and I could not see it anyway in the area. I felt shaken and afraid that someone could do something bad with it which would directly affect me. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly for days. I also couldn‚Äôt get into contact with the reader either so it‚Äôs fair to say I‚Äôve been worried ever since. 

Please can someone advice me on what to do next?

Should I leave it alone?

Should I do the ritual again?

Should I do something else?

I would really appreciate any positive answers as I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone in my life about this as the people around me would not approve of this. 

Thank you in advance!

Honey Jar Advice,10,fvdqbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fvdqbg/honey_jar_advice/,3,1586121847.0,"I was on another forum and someone suggested I try a honey jar because I'm new to spellcasting and they can have powerful effects in heightening someone's attraction. I won't get into the back story, but I made my jar last week. I used Google for my information (again at the suggestion of someone on the other forum, and because you know...quarantine) and put in honey, my paper with our names in crosses and my affirmation in a circle around it, and part of his old toothbrush. I did not have access to an ""actual"" candle so I lit a birthday candle which was red and white intertwined (I read online that white can be used for any purpose and the candle itself doesn't matter). When the candle burned down the wick had tied into itself like a pretzel knot so I thought that was a good sign. I put the jar in my basement and was going to forget about it.

Doing more research the next day it says you should work on the jar either for 7 days or every M W F until the effects start to become apparent. I also read that if you want to sweeten the attraction further you can add cinnamon and vanilla to the jar. There seemed to be mixed reviews online as to whether to open a jar or not after sealing it, so I went with my gut and opened it to add the extra ingredients. After adding the extra ingredients I lit a new red candle that I bought at the store. This candle is one of those thicker taller circle ones that burns slow and doesn't drip. I dressed it in honey, vanilla, cinnamon, and rose oil before lighting it. I did my meditation and stated my affirmation again as I had done the first night. The candle burns so slow I figured I can burn it down over the 7 day period. I find myself sitting and meditating while it burns from anywhere from 1-3 hours a night. The candle is about halfway down now. 

After the second night of burning someone I don't know sent me a random picture of my target online. It was completely unprovoked and the sender did not know that I know his friend (target). I know that is one of the signs that the jar is working (they say you randomly run into your target places, communication picks up, whatever it may be). Since I am starting to see minimal effects should I put the jar back into my basement once the candle finally finishes burning down? How often should I be working on my jar and am I overworking it right now because I unintentionally chose a slow burning candle?

I am in a state where i am torn apart between what i did, and moral standards.

I expect the hate and suing, and its understandable for me. I already sue myself, and can't forgive for what i did.

So long story short, i have this guy, we were in a messed up relationship, where i was the third wheel. He already had/and has someone. But i fell in love with him so hard, never thought i could. When i first saw that guy, i was repulsed and i thought no way, not my type. 3 months passed and i was crazy for him. I guess karma came for my way of  thinking so low for him. And i fell in love so hard, we were in a relationship, and i broke it, i didn't saw a way for us to be together and broke things off. But the guy was pushing constantly to meet up, call me, message me casually. The deal was, we broke up, but stay friends, i said okay.

But he was pushing things further, and even though i subtly told him to leave me alone, and no contact he didn't respected that. Months passed, and i was pissed on his behaviour of not respecting the decision i made and to not contact me anymore. He agreed then, but i had to be blunt so he could understand. 

Again month passes here i am contacting him casually. Friendly conversation. He is into it. We haven't seen each other since last year. 

I love this man, even though i wanted to cut all contact, never see him again. I can lie others, but i can't myself. I love him. 

I did the menstrual blood in his drink spell. I don't know if it will work. I want him to be happy, i never want to see him suffering or be unhappy. But i love him, honestly and with all my being. I am crazy for this man. 


The menstrual blood i poured in a drink, alcohol. But it was colorless so he noticed that the drink had changed colour, but nevertheless he drank from it. Not whole drink, but he did. Two cups, the first he drink it and didn't noticed nothing. 

If anyone is familiar, will this work, or come after me, i am crying all night long for what i did. And for him, because i love him. It sounds possessive, but its not obsession, i love him. There isn't anything i won't do for him, i would without a question give my life for him if i need to show that.

On March 21st my ex and I reunited after close to two years of no contact. We had broken up and he had started a new relationship with someone who ended up being very physically, mentally, and emotionally manipulative. He had broken up with her the week before we reunited so it's fairly fresh. Up until this past Sunday things between him and I were great. We had confessed we still loved each other and that we had wanted to work towards something together again (this time with better communication, etc.)

Well, things changed. We still love each other, however, he wants to work on himself and remain single. He said that he had wanted to be single before our reuniting moment and just got caught up in ""it"" (us reconnecting) at the wrong time. I totally understand his decision.

So what I'm asking here is...is there a spell that I can perform to help him discover himself but still have an interest in rekindling a healthy and communicative romantic relationship?

"Here's a spell for academic success, y'all go forth and ace them online classes",53,fsft3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fsft3s/heres_a_spell_for_academic_success_yall_go_forth/,4,1585700222.0,"This is great on its own, but it's especially helped me during this time when school has switched online and we're all trying to adjust and cope. I thought I'd share with you guys!

What you need (but keep in mind ingredients are always adjustable if needed, due to availability or allergies):

Sunwater - For energy and motivation

Tea - To serve as your base. I used a cup of black tea for energy

Vanilla - Helps restore lost energy (You could even use vanilla tea)

Caraway - To enhance mental powers and memory

Rosemary - For good memory, clear thinking, concentration, and to repel negativity

Strawberry - To increase favorable circumstances, success, and good fortune


Using the sunwater, brew your tea and add the rest of the ingredients. I just opened the tea bag and poured in about half a teaspoon of dried rosemary and caraway seed to make straining easier, and added a piece of chopped strawberry to the water along with a couple of drops of vanilla extract. State the intent for each ingredient as you add them, and then let the tea steep. 

Once it's done, strain and add sugar if you want--sugar is used to attract in the same way that salt is used to banish--and stir clockwise as you charge it with your intent; you can be more broad or more narrow. For me it's ""I'll do great in all of my classes this semester"", and since that's quite broad, I'll probably be repeating this ritual regularly. But you could also do something like ""I'll ace that final exam"" or ""I'll make an A on that research paper"", etc. I also hold my hand over the cup and let the stream wet my fingers, which I then use to annoint myself on my forehead. This is a perfect spell to perform in the morning before you get to work, because of its energizing and motivating qualities :)",spells

Does anyone have a protection spell I could use for this situation?,9,fokwth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fokwth/does_anyone_have_a_protection_spell_i_could_use/,2,1585143136.0,"Okay so I have dreams and I‚Äôm not sure how to explain it but I tend to know when I‚Äôm having a prophetic dream versus a normal one, they kind of have a sort of overlay visually. It‚Äôs hard to explain. They usually manifest exactly how the dream plays out but very rarely they‚Äôre more symbolic and make sense later. I can usually tell which is which but this time I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôm currently sat up in bed because I awoke from a prophetic dream (not sure whether symbolic or actual). In this dream, I was sat on my couch  with my mother, and I knew that someone was coming for me at 7:00pm, someone bad. I was doing normal stuff for a while like I was just okay? With the situation. I kept looking at a photograph of someone. Later on in the dream, I looked towards my phone and it said 7:09pm. I set everything I was holding down and just waited. A few moments later a man in a hoodie came around the corner and his face was initially obscured by a white light. 

Me and a friend have been seeing the same figure in dreams, who is pure white. In hers, he spoke and it sounded demonic to her and she ran. In mine, I was chasing him. I‚Äôm not sure if this is at all connected but I thought the white light was a fairly big coincidence to have. 

When he came around the corner the light slowly died off and I saw his face. I don‚Äôt recognise this man at all, and he was asking me about the person in the photograph, asking me where they were. I was calmly saying that the person was dead, incredibly calmly. Then, the man was crying and he started to hack at my hands, cutting them. I could feel the pain but I was still quite calm, and then I woke up. 

Not sure if real or symbolic but definitely prophetic. I‚Äôm not sure how to explain how I know, it‚Äôs just kind of like a dark sort of holographic overlay. But I know. 

Anyway, the reason this has freaked me out so much is because I and my family were robbed as a child and I woke up during to see five armed men in my living room. I was Christian back then, I‚Äôm not now but I had a dream about it weeks before it happened, and couldn‚Äôt accept that my dreams meant something at that time because of my religion. I didn‚Äôt believe in anything like this. That dream, though quite outlandish with the choices of weapons and what they said, was a ‚Äòreal‚Äô dream. It happened exactly as I dreamt it. Now, I‚Äôm incredibly worried about this one. Can anyone recommend a relatively simple protection spell? I‚Äôm new to spell work but I need the piece of mind. Thanks in advance and sorry if I rambled a bit, I just felt that it called for being more specific about the situation.",spells

Ritual of Self-Actualisation,16,fmai81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fmai81/ritual_of_selfactualisation/,2,1584799703.0,"RITUAL OF SEIZING THE MORN/RITUAL OF SELF-ACTUALISATION

This is a Ritual I have created and use daily, the Ritual took a little bit of structural inspiration from the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, however it must be made clear; 

	THIS IS NOT A BANISHING RITUAL. THIS IS NOT AN ADAPTATION OF THE LBRP, SIMILAR ONLY IN STRUCTURE. 

This Ritual is designed for daily use, its purpose is to 'Actualise' the self for the day, to realise and understand that you are part of nature, that you are of the Earth, and have a lot of potential. It is a ritual to be done daily, upon waking and bathing, it can be used as a confidence booster, a motivator, an invocation of energy, and awaking your own energy, power raising, and as intended; for Self Actualisation (realising the power you possess). A seizing the day ritual if you will. 

	Things needed:

	Something to represent the four elements, for e.g:

	1 bowl of water (Water - West) 

	1 stick of incense (Air - North) 

	1 bowl of salt or stones (Earth - East) 

	1 lit candle or dagger (South - Fire)

Now set up the elemental symbols on the floor in their respected positions. I am using a statue of a raven to represent the Air, and a plant to represent the Earth. Position them so that you are in between them, with enough space to move around.
Bathe and be present in clean clothes, or naked. Light the candle. 

Power Raising/Self-Actualization

Enter the space you have made with the symbols of the elements and face the East, in the direction of Earth. 

Touch your forhead with the index finger of your right hand and take a moment to calm the mind. Visualise stardust, the dust and rocks and atoms in space that formed the planets, and the stars, imagine this multicoloured crystal energy; this divine stardust forming everything; space, planets, galaxies, etc. Visualise this power forming the self, swirling around you (you as a person) and realise what you know to be true; that you are of the Earth. 

When the visualisation is strong, vibrate the words ""Alive"" and ""Awake"", do this in one breath for each word; like this:
	
	""AAAALLLLL - IIIIIIIIIVVVVE""

Next breath:

	""AAAAAAA - WAAAAAAAKE""

Now point your right hand to the sky and your left to the ground (similar to the symbolism of The Magician Tarot Card, of the Arthur Edward Waite Deck) and form that pose. Now visualise even more strongly this stardust, now it is coming from the ground into the left hand, and from the sky into the right hand, feel it. You are a catalyst of Magick, magick is you. Know again that you are of the Earth, a part of this world, a part of nature. 
Now vibrate these words while visualising: 

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""

Say it like this; 
	first breath equals 

	""IIIIIIIII - AMMMMM - OOONNNNNE"" 

Second breath equals

	""ONNNNNNNE - ISSSSS - MEEEEE"" 

Third beath equals

	""AALLLLLLL - ISSSSSSSSSS - ONNNNNNNNE"" 

What is being done here is what I like to call Self-Actualisation, also the visualisation is being vocalised; that the self (you) are the same divinity of the world around us, 'you' are one and one is all. Continue the visualisation of the Divine power moving through you, until you see it and feel it strongly. Know you are a part of nature, and of power.

Now, still facing East. Slash through the air like a knife of strong winds. And vibrate:

	""Mighty as wind"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""MIIIIIGHT - YYYYY - ASSSSS - WIIIIIIIIND"" 

Then say:

	""As strong as the hardest winds, but I am a gentle breeze"" 

Draw a pentegram with your hand in the air, within the pentegram, visualise the space and stars, and multicoloured crystal energies, the same space and stars from earlier. 
	
Now put the hands together in a prayer like position and visualise absorbing bright yellow energy coming from the depth of space. When satisfied with strong visualisation, Bow, then turn to the South. 

Facing South. Punch forward directly, like a directed flame. Vibrate:

	""Fierce as Flames"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""FIIIII - ERRRRRRRCE - ASSSSS - FLAAAAAAMMES"" 

Then say:

	""Fierce as a directed fire and warm as the brightest flame""

Repeat the pentegram, imagine the space, the Divine energies, space and stars flowing within and around, 
Hands as before, prayer like and visualise. This time the energy you are absorbing is bright red energies from inside the pentegram, from the vastness of space. Allow this red energy to fill you up. Bow, then turn towards the West. 

Facing West. Lift arm up, like throwing heavy waves. And vibrate:

	""Soul of the Waves"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""SOOOULLLLL - OFFFF - THEEEEE - WAVVVVVES"" 

Then say:

	""Mighty as the grandest wave and calming as the sea"" 

Again, repeat the pentegram and visualisation of deep space within it, the Magickal multi coloured crystal like energy. 
Now hands in prayer position again, visualise absorbing beautiful blue energies from the depth of space, from within the pentegram, allow this blue to fill you. Bow, and turn towards the North. 

Facing North. Tense the arm to symbolise the strength of the earth. Vibrate:

	""Steadfast as Earth"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""STEEEAADD - FAAAST - ASSSSS - EARRRRRTH"" 

Then say:

	""Steadfast as Earth and the body of all life"" 

Again repeat the pentegram and visualisation of the Divine energy and space, hands in prayer position, visualise absorbing wondrous green energies this time, from the depth of space. 

Turn back towards the East. Visualise all the different colours and energies flowing all around you and through you. 
Again, repeat The Magician Pose and absorb all these energies, allow them to crash around you, into you, you are brimming with the power of the elements, now just like before, repeat these earlier vibrations:

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""
	(While in The Magician Pose) 

Then touch forhead and vibrate:

	""Alive"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

	""Awake"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

Stomp right foot or ring a bell to conclude. 

You are now self actualized and ready for all, aware of the power you possess. 

	NOTE: ALL PENTAGRAMS DRAWN SHOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR, BE IT A BEAUTIFUL BLUE OR BLINDING WHITE. THEY ARE INVOKING PENTAGRAMS.

Since in Italy nobody can go out, we facetime and we call each other. We use WhatsApp too. And he lives in front of my house. I really like where this is going! YAY! 
Edit: someone asked me to share the spell, so here it is! First, light a candle. Then, bring that candle in your bathroom and have a purifying bath. Keep the candle near you for about one and an half hour after the bath. Then, place your candle in your altar, and write on a little piece of paper what you want from that spell. I wrote: ""when this candle will burn down, (his name) will start seeing my qualities and my inner and outer beauty and my personality."" I folded the piece of paper, and I put it in the melting wax. You can burn it in the candle's flame, but since the spell will start when the candle burns down, the piece of paper will follow the candle burning. And that's it, let the candle burn down and keep the container, so the spell's energy will remain in your room. This started working the same day the candle consumed itself. You will notice a big change on how person acts towards you! ‚ô°",spells
Is there such a thing as a skeptic Witch/how do you usually go about developing your spells?,22,fjwcmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjwcmb/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_skeptic_witchhow_do/,10,1584436329.0,"So, for a bit of context, I personally don't believe in magic yet.

"Energy Work to help you in the COVID ""panic""",37,fjl6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjl6pq/energy_work_to_help_you_in_the_covid_panic/,0,1584395147.0,"An ER nurse in the r/energy_work forum asked what she can do to help deal with both the medical dangers, but also the dark and panicky energy she's surrounded by during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to share my ideas here too, in case any of you are worried or affected.  


\*\*\*  
If you can wear a quartz crystal then put it into a bowl of salt every time you go home and take it off, that will help. You can also wear hematite, tiger eye, sunstone, and obsidian. I know  that a necklace may not be allowed in the ER but even an ankle bracelet would help. Just have the stones on your person somewhere. All those stones do well to absorb negativity. To add in positive mood energy, wear or carry amethyst and rose quartz.

Next, I know you won't want to wear TOO much perfume, but if you can put some lavender oil, calendula (marigold) oil, and citrus essential oil on your pulse points, that would help.Consider dressing your helper stones and crystal with that oil as well.

On your break, go outside if you can and put your back against a stone or tree. Even a stone or brick wall can help. Feel yourself ""melting"" into the tree or stone. Feel the calm stable strength of it. Let energy reach down into the earth along with the tree roots or the foundation of the wall or stone. Let your energy extend up out of your fingertips like branches. To an outsider it will just look like you raise up your arms and have a good stretch so don't be embarrassed what others may think.Take a deep breath in through your nose and just push/dump/drain all the energy in your body down through your feet into the ground. Then take another breath and breathe in fresh energy, pulling it down from the sky and the clouds and the air. Do that 3 times total. If you know how to shield, then finish by putting your auric shields back up.

The next thing I do is sit in a few minutes of meditation while charging my stones and magickal tools. I imagine a roaring hot campfire, too hot to sit next to. I feel the heat on my face and hands, I see the flickering light. I hear the wood popping and snapping in the flames and the rush of the hot air rising, the low roar of the fire. I try to smell the good spicy musky woodsmoke scent.

It's ok to use a candle, a fireplace, or just a video of a campfire, to help visualize. Then I imagine myself being hollow and light, as if my bones were hollow conduits. And I ""reach out"" energetically and pull that campfire into me. As if my belly was the fireplace and my chest and throat and head were the chimney. I sit there for a few minutes and try to become fire. 

This is AMAZING for your immune system. I have a stage IV terminal cancer and after multiple rounds of chemo my oncologist keeps saying ""I have no idea how your white blood cell count and platelets and hematocrit look this good with the chemo cocktail you are on, but whatever you're doing just keep doing it.""  


A similar meditation is to lie looking up into the starry night sky and feel yourself drifting up into it. Drift among the stars, then drift over to one. Feel the incredible power of the giant furnace of the star, then pull it into yourself and have a hot yellow-white sun burning inside your 3rd chakra, in your belly. You can even do a galaxy! That's less good for immune system, but good for protection, and great for grabbing a huge pile of energy to use to create a reality or heal others.   


Using the same technique, toss a mint bath bomb down in your shower and stand under the coolest temperature water that still feels good. Become waterfall. Become crashing waves. This is good for clearing out emotional energy that doesn't belong to you.  


All day at work, every time things get crazy, take one second to just \*feel\* that fire in your lower chakras roar up, like throwing a log on a campfire.

Learn the Cho Ku Rei symbol. Pull a ball of that fire energy into your hand and sneakily draw the symbol on anything that needs some darn powerful healing, fast. You can also google and learn the Se He Ki symbol and draw it anytime you feel in danger or on anything that seems to need protection. You don't need to be attuned to Reiki energy in order to use those symbols - they work fine to direct ANY healing energy.

Consider hopping into r/ReikiPractitioners and asking if you could be given Reiki attunements. It CAN be done even from a distance on a video call, in some traditions. Energy healing disregards physical distance in many ways. Reiki could do a lot to protect you, and also to save patients that might otherwise not do as well. I like to think of Reiki as that one small weight on the scale to tip the balance - if you're kinda getting sick, but your immune system is also kinda fighting it off, Reiki is SO GOOD at giving things that little ""shove"" so you fight off a cold instead of catching it.  And similar situations. If a person is in the balance, and they 50/50 might make it, or might not, Reiki is the energy work ""tool"" needed there IMO.",spells

What do do when feeling irritable and drained?,26,fhqqsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fhqqsc/what_do_do_when_feeling_irritable_and_drained/,2,1584087967.0,"Someone in my energy work & reiki subreddit asked this question; what can you do with magic and energy work, when you feel drained and irritable all the time - how can you use energy to help with that?  


 I wanted to share my answer here too since I think it's a good question - and hopefully you guys will share ideas so I can pass them on to my friends over at r/energy_work

\*\*\*  


Go outside and stand with your back against a tree, and with your energy, copy what the tree's energy is doing. If you don't sense energy at that detailed level yet, visualize that the bark is melting and letting you melt into the tree trunk. Feel your toes dig into the dirt like roots, imagine white root-shaped lines of energy sinking down into the dirt. Raise your arms and stretch up, feel your fingers extend into long branched green tendrils of energy.

Also be aware that just like physical irritation, emotional irritation is a sign that something in your environment is being unhealthy and toxic. If you kept breaking out in a weird rash, you hopefully would not ignore it! You'd go searching for the cause, then get it out of your diet or body or environment. Same with mental/emotional irritation.

It's often overwork and burnout - but putting up with energy vampire type people is a common trigger too. Energy vamp types don't always make you feel BAD - heck, they can be really exciting fun people, just very draining and tiring if you have to deal with them for hours/days. A narcissist in your life can be worse than an actual energy vamp, so [r/narcissism](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/) or similar subreddit might be a place to check and see if you know anyone like that.

If you just cannot get rid of the cause, because it's a person who is too deeply part of your life, then there's things you can do. Shield, shield, shield. Learn to make yourself the energy equivalent of a tank :) Plenty of how-to's out there on that, so I won't duplicate it here. 

Also, grounding. Learn to ground so deep that you feel a hurricane would just make you sway a bit. Again, it's not the method you use, it's how much and how often you practice. Every spare moment. A martial arts teacher once told me ""if you're waiting in line, waiting in a lobby, wherever, you get your feet into one of the stances you've been taught, and practice moving forward correctly in that stance as the line moves up. It can be waiting time, or free practice time; your choice."" 

When shielding, centering, grounding, and raising energy is what you're constantly practicing, it's also helping you feel better on many levels. Plus, practicing it in odd locations means if you ever need to use it in a really sketchy or scary situation, you're used to being in public and around others, so it won't distract you.

Every time you're bored in a waiting room or a line, this is time to practice energy work drills. I've met some friends at festivals and events that way too. ""I promise I'm not on drugs, I just wanna ask, why are you doing that with your aura?"" Is one of the most memorable ways anyone has ever introduced themselves to me :)

Another spell I like to do is ""gifting"" - every emotion and energy is useful somewhere, sometime, to someone. So, I like to make a glyph or rune that represents my ""unwanted"" emotion, then infuse that glyph with a big ol ball of my emotion and offer it up to the universe as a gift to anyone who currently needs that emotion. I watch it drift away like a soap bubble and I try to imagine a situation where that emotion would be helpful and healing to someone. Even feeling irritable as heck... well, somewhere, there's a person with saint-like patience being taken advantage of by a lazy spouse, for example. It would do them \*good\* to get fed up and give the lazy one an real earful, for once.

If nothing else, doing that energy work and visualization helps me make peace with the emotion - sometimes even decide ""Hey, I kinda wanna keep it, and let it actually \*do\* it's job in my life right now.""",spells

Why is real life sorcery so boring compared to D and D and Harry Potter divine powers found in fiction? Why doesn't real life have magick that allows Force Lightning in Star Wars or Charmed's Piper Freeze Time Ability?,4,fdz0wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fdz0wv/why_is_real_life_sorcery_so_boring_compared_to_d/,6,1583459455.0,"Saw this conversation on Discord.

>While we are at it, a question I've had with TechEmporium. An exact message I sent on a few discord rooms.
>
A frequent point me a TechEmporiun frequently discuss is......... If Magick is real why don't we see fireballs being shot out of people's hands? Or people chanting a name and an earthquake happens?

>This is proof of mass hysteria according to scientiffic magician and he says all occultists and even Christians from Linah at NightHouse to Geno at Occult and Chill to RCR917 and Bassackwards all are buying into.

>There is no ""harry potter"" magick where you wave a wand around and suddenly you create a ray of light that can burn someone according to atheist magician.
Even when people describe incidents where magical stuff appear, nothing is anywhere close to say Super Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z destroying buildings because they shoot out energy blasts or Kenpachi cutting a skyscraper in half with a single sword swing or FOrce Lightning style attacks where electricity literally comes out of your finger tips like Emperor Palpatine.

>Its more boring mundane magick by fictional standards like flying hammers and such. Even by something as more low level and earthly as Charmed, the magic supposed veterans like Xaithu, RCR917, Geno, and Monster at the NIghthouse Discord room encounter is low level like a ceiling collapsing. Not freezing time like Piper could and Force telekenesis liek Prue could or seeing distant future visions like Phoebe could. Nothing that Charmed Halliwell's sister at all.

>I have to ask why even the real magickal stuff is nothing like Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons?
Its for this reason why TechEmporium says all magick is BS and its all just altering your brain's chemical function. He says if D and D magick was real like Zeus throwing lightning, how supposed apparitions like Zeus doesn't shock his opponent with force lightning? Or supposed appearance of Santa Muerte causes instant death to people who anger her in summoning by a black aura spreading in a room like a horror movie?
I'm just so curious how claims like reading minds Jean Grey style or faster than light speed common in anime/manga fights come from? Why mythology is full of them and even the Abrhaamic religionst oo? Yet from people interactions with the gods and demons and whatever the real story is far more boring?

>Can humans actually learn how to control a river to do whipping attacks using water like in some fantasy Wuxia martial arts films and make the earth shake by stomping their foot on the ground and cracking the floor in front of you split wide open like Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender can do? And other D and D style magick?If so how come no occultists have done so in modern times?

I am quite curious why real life magick is so boring and seems to work more by coincidences and laws of science? None of that shooting ray of destructive light out of your finger tip like in YuYu Hakusho and other stuff the Discorder stated in the quote above? Why is it just boring candles that simply tips the balance in say business dealings or subconsciously changes your habit through placebo effect and accessing psychological archetypes?

Even the cases we have of demonic attachment and stuff and defying the science, the magick is so low level like causing a keychain to levitate. We don't have stuff that is close to fictional powerful like Prue waving her arms and destroying an entire room in Charmed or Gandalf using his staff to bring out a sphere of light that blinds an entire battalion of American marines for over 10 minutes! The stuff we have is mostly boring low stuff like bleeding out of nowhere when meeting an angel or someone being lifted midair by an angry spirit. Or feeling the energy of a person (but not necessarily reading his thoughts like Jean Grey in X-Men could).

Rejuvenation Potion and Ritual,30,fa2sl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fa2sl3/rejuvenation_potion_and_ritual/,2,1582789631.0,"Long time witch, first time redditer. Here‚Äôs my favourite recipe of all time. :) 

Rejuvenation potion- perfect for new beginnings. 

First you need moon water charged by a waxing crescent moon for inspiration and hope. If there won‚Äôt be a waxing crescent for a few weeks use sun water instead. 
Next is bergamot oil for invigoration.
Finally, citrine for regeneration and intuition. 

First, take a cleansed crystal and hold it in your hands; channel all your positive energy and hope into the crystal. Next, I charged my moon water with a citrine crystal in the bowl. If you‚Äôre charging your water with the sun then don‚Äôt add citrine yet as the light can degrade the crystal, add the crystal to the sun water for a few hours out of direct sunlight. Remove the citrine, a few drops of bergamot oil to the water and tip it into a glass bottle (ideally with a cork). To make it look prettier I added fresh herbs to the bottle, rosemary for purification and thyme for luck. 

To use the potion I took it outside and found a sunny spot- this can be the grass, soil or even concrete. Even if it‚Äôs a dull day try to find a few moments of sunlight for the spell. Pour the potion (all of it or just a little) in a circle and sit inside it, I sat cross legged on the floor but grab a seat if you need one. Bask in the light for as long as you want to (or as long as you can if the sun hides away), I stayed for about half an hour and meditated. 

That‚Äôs it! Hope you enjoyed this and got some inspiration. How else would you use this potion? How would you change it?",spells

The forum rules have been updated.  The intention of the rules remain unchanged--to provide a safe and content-rich forum where people can knowledge-share about magick.  The wording of the rules was simply updated to improve clarity and communication.  

In particular, the old ""No off-topic"" rule was problematic--people who didn't read the pinned post or expand the off-topic rule to read the full text were unaware that advising mundane solutions rather than magickal solutions was prohibited.  When PMed, people overall were very apologetic, they simply didn't know.

To fix that, the rules have been rewritten so that the expectations around comments are visible above the fold, and a few other minor wording tweaks have been made.

Please avoid posting that you think someone shouldn't be doing magick.  That is explicitly prohibited on this forum; it isn't what people come here to read.  If you feel you absolutely must tell someone your opinion, you can always send a private message.

And please use the report function if you see someone violating a rule.  We don't ban people for first-time off-topic rule violations.  We simply remove the comments and PM them asking them to stop.

This lady told us all we have to do is place the bottle of oil ( which we had to write words on that I never seen before)at the corner of people doors and place the seed on top of the bottle. Then we had to knock at the door and stay close enough to not be seen but to watch. After the person opens the door and look down at the seed it would glow and the person will walk back into their home. Once the person went back into the house we will go back to where the seed was placed and money would appear in place of the seed. The lady said each seed would turn into $300 dollars. I was hesitant at first and watched someone else do it first before I did it myself. Once I saw that it worked the lady told me she will give me a seed that would give me 3√ó the amount. I kept trying to look for a house to place the seed but had difficulty finding the right spot to watch the door so I came across a stand alone mirror that was slightly out of frame and decided to place the oil bottle at the corner of the mirror and the seed in between the mirror and frame opening.

Here is my situation: My family is looking for a new home as the house we rent is being sold. My great grandmother is 91 and still lives alone but relies heavily in my grandparents who live a few minutes from her. They are very charitable people with a large home and have taken her in during rough times in the past. I would assume she will be living with them permanently in the near future. 

If my great grandmother was to leave her home, it would likely remain empty as my aunts and uncles own their own homes ans my cousins are in college. Renting to my family would be an ideal situation in my mind. A stable/ permanent home for us, extra income for my grandparents/great grandmother, a great school system for my kids(the schools in her town are better than the ones in mine), keep the house in the family, put us closer to my extended family-which would allowe to help take care of my great grandmother and for my kids to spend more time with her while she is still here. 

I don't have the courage to bring up this idea with my grandparents or great grandmother. They have helped us out a LOT in the past and it would just feel wrong to ask them for more. But if they were to present the idea, I'd enthusiastically agree. I've been manifesting, I just want to do more.

In search of powerful love spells that have worked before,1,j8tazf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j8tazf/in_search_of_powerful_love_spells_that_have/,9,1602396173.0,"First of all, hi. I've had a break up in July of this year (2020) and ever since it I've been devastated. Our relationship was everything for me, and I truly felt a incredibly deep connection with her, like she was my soulmate. Some might not believe me on this, but I also didn't until we met. It was, or at least felt, like a perfect relationship with the right person. But well, she broke up with me.

I would have been much worse if it wasn't for a friend of mine that taught me sigil magic and how to make a servitor. This servitor I made currently works (mostly) at night, when the mind is more influentiable and dark/black magic is stronger, and it makes her love me more than she already does.

However, as the days passes I start to become insecure, afraid or anxious with the lack of results or progress. I don't doubt it can work, but because it can only influence her (can't overcome her free will) I feel like it will take too long for me. I have self-control, but to use a servitor for months without seeing progress doesn't feel different from white magic or prayers.

I come here in search of a powerful love spell that has worked before and will bring her back to me in a short time.

For context, my family and I have been having some rough times lately, with my friend having to move in with us to escape an abusive situation, to us having problems with selling our house and finding a new place to live, to having to move out of our apartment because of restrictions on pets and the number of people who can be in the house.

Broomstick Spell: For Ensuring Commerce & Prosperity for your Business,23,j7ehrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j7ehrs/broomstick_spell_for_ensuring_commerce_prosperity/,0,1602197711.0,"Hey All,

Thought I'd share a spell which I performed last new moon which has been working really well for me. It can also be performed on a Wednesday (Mercury - Commerce) during a waxing moon (growth period).

Ingredients: 1 Charcoal Disk in a fireproof dish & Benzoin resin granules / Matches / Chopped Basil (dried or fresh) / 1 green candle (I'd recommend no less than 6hr burn time) / 1 yellow candle / 1 Small broom or hand brush / Large bunch fresh Rosemary / 2 yards twine or string / 30cm string of dried juniper berries / 6 drops of mint essential oil

Casting the Spell:

1. Cast the circle (search the sub if you are not sure how, there will be other instructions for how to open / close a circle)
2. Light the charcoal disk and sprinkle on the Benzoin & Basil
3. Light the green candle and say ""Earth, witness this spell"". Light the yellow candle and say ""Air, carry it well""
4. Tie the Rosemary around the handle of the brush, then wrap the twine around until it is completely used, chanting as you do: ""Born of earth, carried in air, increase worth, away with care"". Fasten it off then tie the string of berries around the twine.
5. Anoint the handle & brush with the Mint oil. Pass the brush over the incense smoke 3 times, saying ""Once I invest thee, Twice I impress thee, Thrice I then bless thee"". Leave the brush with the candles until they burn out.
6. Keep the brush over the doorway of your business (I work from home so keep mine over my front door)

Hope this is useful for someone. Let me know if you have any q's. The spell is taken from the book 'The Spells Bible' by Ann-Marie Gallagher.

Manifesting With The Moon,30,j2fu9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2fu9h/manifesting_with_the_moon/,0,1601470846.0,"# Only approximately 239,00 miles away from the Earth, there is no doubt that the extraordinary, celestial mass in our night sky-- The Moon-- has powerful control over the Earth and its people.¬†

While the Sun represents masculine energy, the Moon represents the utmost powerful feminine energy. She signifies intuition, birth, death, and reincarnation and represents our hidden emotions, desires, worries, and self-work.

Spiritually, she acts as our Mama, subtly reminding her children that everything on Earth is ever-changing and follows a natural cycle. She offers us the ability to feel, nourish, learn from the past, and creatively unlock and express our authentic selves.

THE NEW MOON

The New Moon is the first phase in the Lunar cycle. It occurs when The Moon comes into direct alignment in the Sun. When the Sun becomes possessive of the Moon and he does not want to share her beauty with the Earth, we are shown emptiness representing a time for fresh starts and new beginnings. It‚Äôs time to rest and begin planting new seeds of desire and intention by writing them down. This is the time to meditate and gently breathe new life into any areas of stagnation in which you wish to thrive.

THE FULL MOON

The Full Moon follows the Waxing Gibbous. The Sun and the Moon are in harmony and the Sun reflects his brilliance off the Moon‚Äôs surface, creating her own light for us to use. This phase represents intense thoughts and powerful breakthroughs. Full moons are thought to influence humans so powerfully, there is a record of heightened emotions and even psychosis. This is the time to reflect. Allow yourself to analyze what‚Äôs working for you--or what‚Äôs not. Celebrate this realization-- this is the universe connecting with you.

&#x200B;

To make the work day go faster (try not to look at the clock too often after saying it and for an extra boost, repeat to yourself or out loud several times throughout the day 'I can't believe how fast the day's going' or 'wow. It's already lunchtime or whatever time'):

'Time flies when you're having fun.

But that is not now, so let it be done.

Let the time fly by so fast.

So that this work day will not last.'

&#x200B;

When I'm trying to do something creative and the Muse just won't flow:

'Muse of art, Muse of sound, Muse of thought gather round.

Come to me with your guiding light. Guide my hand in this creative rite.

And as I call your spirits forth, so shall it be.'

&#x200B;

When I need to focus OR could use a little boost of luck (works for both...just got to set the intention):

'Right time, right place

Sacred moment, sacred space

From sky above to earth below

I am in my perfect flow.'

&#x200B;

And finally, the most simple:

Simply repeat to yourself several time throughout the day:

 'Everything works out in my favor.'

Things like allowing a certain worry to build up inside of me until I feel I have no choice to speak to my friend about it, only for them to end up getting upset at me because of it.

Which in turn just gives rise to a new worry and concern of mine, will then go through the same cycle, getting myself worried to the point that said topic comes up in conversation and then end up harming the relationship further.

The worry I am experiencing is that we had an incident some three weeks ago. It took awhile to get them speaking to me again, though it is in a public discord and not a private chat like we usually are. I guess it is because they don't trust me enough to speak to me in a private setting at the moment.

There is a worry that things won't return to the way they were before the argument, combined with trying to be patient enough that things recover over time in their own right, and if they are still upset with me. (Which if they were upset with me, why speak to me and include me in playing Among Us for a full night, or allowing me to be on her telegram and discord?)

To compound the fact, their father and step mom got diagnosed with Covid. And I am struggling on exactly how to help them as they had asked to not be flooded with DM's at the time, as they are still struggling to process it; plus the trouble of distance.

***TLDR***; I don't want to allow this mixture of worry to overcome me. I want to do a spell to protect me from this worry, and rebuild my friends trust in me by showing them I respect and listen to their requests.",spells

Blood Magick for Healing Spell?,13,iscgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iscgpr/blood_magick_for_healing_spell/,5,1600080405.0,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to make this as brief as I can. My partner was recently diagnosed with having UVH (Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction). It's a bit rare compared to BVH, and we're pretty young. To break it down, UVH is when one ear stops communicating proper signals to the brain, which then compromises one's sense of balance. It basically feels like you're drunk all the time, but without any of the good feelings from it. At least that's how my partner puts it. It might be permanent, but it might go away on its own within several weeks. Currently what we're able to do is some physical therapy exercises to retrain the nerve to properly communicate with his brain.

However, I've been thinking about working a spell for my partner that may help the healing process, even if I can reduce the dizziness for him too. And that's why I wanted to know if its a good idea to use blood magick (a prick of the finger really) to amplify the healing spell. I will more than likely get a strand or two of his hair as well to make the spell as specific for him as I possibly can. 

I've never included blood magick in my spells before, because I know it's very powerful. I don't include certain things in my energy work unless I know I've done my research for it.

Thoughts? Have any of you ever done blood magick to help amplify a healing spell? How'd it turn out? I'd really appreciate some stories. Thanks in advance!",spells

Saturday Spell Challenge: self love spell using only one tool,38,iepnbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iepnbp/saturday_spell_challenge_self_love_spell_using/,5,1598156298.0,"We so often have questions about what ingredients to buy, tools to use, etc when it comes to spell casting, but it‚Äôs good to remember that you have everything you really need to get started already!

For this spell challenge: create &amp; share a spell for self-love and acceptance using only one magical tool (or no tools!)

For mine:

Start by taking a shower or bath to refresh &amp; renew, meditate &amp; visualize on the water cleansing you physically, and also removing any ‚Äúouter rind‚Äù built up on your mind/psyche.  Maybe you‚Äôve been having to toughen up lately, to push through fatigue at work, or have been self-medicating.  Let the water rinse away the tough outer shell you have built through these survival mechanisms.  Let the water leave you bare, naked and vulnerable, cleansed of facade and receptive to change.

Dry off, but don‚Äôt apply any moisturizers/creams/after shower routine.  Find a nice place to be alone with a mirror, behind closed doors (full length mirror is best).  Dim the lights and work by candlelight if that best sets the tone.

Cast a circle/sacred space/raise energy in the way that fits your tradition, but without using tools ‚Äî only your body, your mind, and your spiritual connections.

If you work with divine feminine or nurturing spirits, call on them at this time to work through you.

Place an oil, salve or cream that you use in your magical practice (the one tool) on the palms of your hands, rub them together slowly and open up the channel between you and your concept of the divine/spiritual mother.  Continue to work your hands until your hands are her hands and no longer your own.

Disrobe infront of the mirror, and have the courage to not look away.  Confront the parts of your body that unsettle you, scare you, or make you feel ashamed.  For each part, think about:

1) What is the nature of this feeling?

2) What are the thoughts that lead to it?

3) What external places do these thoughts come from?  Media, judgmental family members, societal norms or pressures?

Remember: your hands are now HER hands.  She is with you.  Use your hands to comfort you in the way a mother would.  If things get too intense, turn away from the mirror and re-center your mind on her presence before returning to the mirror. 

On the part of your body that you are focusing on, rub the oil into your skin, with gentle and loving motions like a mother figure would.  Call upon your nurturing spirits or divine feminine to act through your hands to bless this part of you and to remind you that it is holy, beautiful and powerful.  Trace your sacred symbols with your hands over this part, taking your time.

Apply more oil to the rest of your skin, like you would a moisturizer.  Replace the space left behind by removing your hard outer shell with the oil/salve as a renewing and protecting layer of the divine feminine.  Take a long time with this, giving extra attention where needed.

Conclude by paying extra attention on the area of your chest/heart (or where you feel the most tension).

Now, place your body in the positions of any divine poses you know, such as those depicted in statues of your tradition.  If you don‚Äôt know any, ask the divine feminine you work with to teach one to you, or create a pose that represents beauty, power, magic or motherhood.  In the mirror, realize the beauty that you have created with your own body.

At this time, do what you feel most compelled to ‚Äî close the circle, thank your spirits, journal about the experience, divine, craft, meditate more deeply on the thoughts/feelings that arose, do something that makes you feel powerful, sleep, have an ugly cry, watch the AOC makeup video ‚Äî all are valid!

Over the next few days, take some time to research depictions &amp; descriptions of divine, spiritual, mythological women through history and across cultures, such as:

[Ancient Venus figurines of Europe](https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/france-venus-figurines.jpg)

There are a few ‚Äúcreatures‚Äù that appear regularly One is a nearly fully clothed in black fabric that looks like bandages with three fingered hands that looks either burned or severely cut. The face is carved out, with dried blood seen and the cloth covering the top of its head. It has on three occasions rotated it‚Äôs head so it‚Äôs chin is facing the sky and I see him under beds and through the edges of doors. He is also maybe 4‚Äô9 although I‚Äôve seen him as tall as my door maybe 6‚Äô0 and his elbows are like knees and he scuttles all over my walls he appears the second most

There is one with a yellow cardigan, maybe 7‚Äô0, wearing what I think is blue jeans and a bowl hair cut, I only see blues as he runs past or as I turn I think he has a partially wrinkly face, maybe 50 and a massive smile yet I know his hair is strictly black, I often see him whilst in cars or other transport. He is there pretty much every car drive and occasionally walking a shaggy dog


There is also a 5‚Äô5 ish woman in a flowery bride dress with her veil thingy torn. She has stark blue eyes and jet black hair. She has one of those really strong jaw lines. Sometimes I see her but her face and hands are withered and grey and her eyes look like the ones blind people have. She always appears in mirrors late at night in the dark. She is in mirrors and other reflective surfaces.


And there is also a man with a sort of Indiana Jones hat, long sleeves of what I assume is a suit and smart trousers and black shoes. It‚Äôs hard to make him out because he is totally black, he is opaque and black everywhere, like the void. He is maybe a little shorter than the woman. He can also be in other shapes, like a fat man, and I giant hairy thing with massive arms. He always appears at night, seen through pretty much everywhere the other spooky things have been mentioned, the corner of my eye, door cracks mirrors and once lying on the bed next to me, looking right at me, to which I promptly turned the lights on and he disappeard. He has twice shown his only non black feature, his teeth. Once through a door crack looking at me sideways with his mouth smiling with literal sharpened triangle teeth with his mouth stretched too wide, the second time when he was lying next to me.
I see him a lot
He is pure evil to the core and I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling he is always watching, waiting for be to let my guard down. Something about him just seems purely demonic in every way I can think of. I have terrible nightmares about him where whenever i speak or ask anything or even move towards him he opens his mouth, revealing fire inside of him. I don‚Äôt know if he is laughing, taunting or just explaining he wants to watch the world burn. 

There are many other dark things I have no physical image of but I feel them there.

I added salt, eggshell,  basil, chamomile, tumeric and black pepper. I ALSO added red rosebuds and a forget-me-not.

This is a spell from the Old Ways, one of the easiest to perform and involves ancient magic.  From foraging to cooking, all these arts go into this spell and will help create harmony, peace and love in your home, wherever and whoever you are. 

It is basically a compote which when you serve to your loved ones/housemates it will create the harmony that you desire.  Take 1kg of wild damsons, 400g sugar, a splash of moon water (120ml or so) and a single chopped lavender flower. Boil together for ten minutes.  When stirring your wooden spoon becomes your wand, and this is when you stir your intent into the spell.

I befriended the dog and the owners even let me take him home for sleepovers on freezing nights sometimes. I tried to buy the dog many times and they always refused. My friend still tries to look out for him and takes him to the vet when he needs it. We agreed that if the dog ever gets out of his yard again like he sometimes does that my friend would keep him till i can drive out and get him. My last ditch effort will be to steal him, but the house has cameras, the dogs skittish and might not remember me from a year ago, its not an easy heist. My friends going to try and buy him (i'm giving him the money) since they are neighbors and gotten along and might not refuse him like me. The guy beat his wife and she moved out with the cops today, so my friend is going to offer her a couple grand for the dog. Its more likely she will sell cause she needs the money and its a fuck you to her husband. If not we have to try to go throught the husband again.

So for some background, I (20f) started practicing when I was 13. It was something I‚Äôd always been interested in and I had previous paranormal/psychic experiences, and essentially I just wanted to see if it would work. Not great intentions to start off with but fuck it worked. My mindset then changed to wanting to see how open I could get, how far I could go. 

I did a lot of research and read a lot of books, but with witchcraft you don‚Äôt really know what you‚Äôre dealing with. You really do get everything back threefold lmao. I opened myself up way way too fucking much and it became a problem. I‚Äôve talked to multiple psychics/mediums and how they‚Äôve described it is that I‚Äôm basically ‚Äúa walking portal‚Äù. Super cool super fun. 

I was around 17 or 18 when things started to get a little out of control, so I shut myself down and haven‚Äôt practiced since. Recently I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôm ready to get back into it, and I really want to cast a protection spell for the protesters (specifically the ones in Portland), but I‚Äôm afraid the second I open myself up to that again the flood gates will open lol. How can I protect myself while casting a protection spell? I‚Äôd also love to hear about others experiences and some protection spells/rituals they‚Äôve used! Thank you!",spells

Devising a personalized Beauty Spell,29,hx24pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hx24pv/devising_a_personalized_beauty_spell/,5,1595627466.0,"Bright Blessings!

I recently nabbed a gorgeous [Body Candle](https://shopemone.com/products/naked-torso-candle) and am interested in devising a beauty spell. Not a temporary glamour spell, but a long-lasting beauty spell - one which will promote permanent and gradual changes and help me in bringing about the vision I have for myself. I personally have yet to come across any such spells and I know others may be interested in something like this as well. As such, I figured I could ask for some help to come up with a successful spell/ritual which others can use as well.

So far, all I can think of in my limited experience is to carve my name into the candle and burn it (can't decide if over some days or all at once) during the waxing phase (the growing moon symbolic for growing allure) whilst meditating on my intent and visualizing my ideal self. Perhaps I could write a standard petition and place it under the candle as well. These seem like basic and sufficient ideas enough, but I am eager to know if anyone here may have any suggestions to increase the spell's potency or turn it into a full-fledged ritual by incorporating other aspects and ideas to make it even more personalized. I would appreciate any and all advice.

Much thanks!

Edit: I often invoke goddesses in my spells and rituals. Aphrodite is an instinctive association for this, but I would appreciate any other ideas as well, even those that don't denote invoking any god(s).",spells

I know that there is going to be a property for me in that area, I just feel it when the timing is right. So I feel I need some kind of timing spell and not sure what kind to cast, do I cast a timing spell for the time I believe its going to reveal itself?

Should I even cast a timing spell or should I cast a different kind of spell to seek out property?

Opening the Third Eye Spell,33,hsbti8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hsbti8/opening_the_third_eye_spell/,5,1594942724.0,"There is so much written about the third eye, i do not know whether it is right or it is wrong as I can only tell you of my experience in opening it.  The first time, i looked up on the net and saw that you should do deep meditation for this, i was instantly dispirited as I have the attention span of a goldfish and am simply unable to meditate for any length of time.

However my guide told me that I should cast a circle first of all.  There are two reasons for this, the first is for protection and safety as when you are psychically open you are psychically vulnerable.   The second is so the circle can magnify your power and ability.  

Like a good trainee I did as I was told, I cast the circle and then sat in it comfortably and gently massaged the third eye area on my forehead.  Then I opened my mind to feel any emotions that were coming in.  I also noted how my eyesight was behaving as I kept on seeing a fuzziness in the air, like a heat haze, which shimmered and glimmered around a certain area.  The fuzziness in the air turned out to be a spirit, my spirit guide in fact and he at that time told me that should I choose to open my mind to the occult, I cannot ever properly close it, i can tune out of it, but never shut it off.  He asked me if I was willing to carry on, and being young I said, without hesitation, yes.  

If he asked me the same question now, I am not sure what I would do, There is great things that came from realising my pyschic side, the mediumship, the wonder, the magic and the awe at the world.  However I have now encountered many many less salubrious forms and having to deal with those is scary, anger making, difficult, tiring and emotionally draining. Am I happier for it?  On the whole I think yes.  Or at least more resigned.

Sex Drive Spell,49,he66gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/he66gw/sex_drive_spell/,4,1592908027.0,"Baby witch here, so bear with me!

I've been having trouble getting in the mood with my partner. I'm not sure why - I'm VERY happy with my partner, who is so so understanding when I'm just not feeling it and when we DO have sex, it's incredible so I'm not sure why I don't want it ALL THE TIME. But, be it stress or lack of confidence or what have you, I rarely feel sexual at all.

So, as with most things since I've begun practicing, I got witchy with it!

Keep in mind: this is what works for ME. Everyone is different and you have to find your own power and your own way! But this works WONDERS for me personally.

All you need is:
2 candles (1 red, 1 white)
Essential oils for anointing (I used lavender, rosemary, red grapefruit, and rose - romantic scents, but feel free to substitute with what you like personally!)
A shower!

So I rub both candles down with the oil while whispering my intentions (""I am sexual. I am sensual. I am passionate."") Then with oil still on my fingers, I draw a line down my chest. Then I lit both candles and let them burn while I got into a hot shower.
While in the shower, I imagine all of my insecurities being washed away. I picture them swirling down the drain as I clean myself and breathe in the smell from the oils and the candles. I still put forth my intentions - ""I am a goddess. I am powerful. I am beautiful.""
Once out of the shower: I blow out both candles, pour the wax from the red candle onto the white candle, relight the white candle, and let it burn in the bedroom until...you know...afterwards!

I hope this helps anyone who has the same frustrations. It really was a game changer for me! Good luck!",spells

Litha sun energy talisman,20,hctr9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hctr9r/litha_sun_energy_talisman/,0,1592715881.0,"Today I celebrated my first Litha as officially pagan. I wanted to make or do something special and decided I wanted to make my self a talisman to contain solar energy. Sharing is caring so I thought I'd post what I did here incase anyone finds it useful.

For background, I have depression & anxiety. I find it gets worse in the winter due to the lack of sunlight. My intent for this talisman was to capture or soak up the midsummer solar energy into an object that I can then tap into in the darker months if I find I'm struggling.

I used a bipoint sunstone crystal with one end larger than the other, orange jewelry wire and some wax. I left the sunstone and wire out from just after dawn until sunset in full sunlight to soak up as much energy as possible. 

At sunset, I lit a candle and incense and used the wire to fashion a net or cage tight around the crystal to contain and support it. I started at the bottom, ensuring the lower, larger point was accessible and wove up to the thinner point. Whilst I did this I meditated and visualised solar energy as a golden, glowing liquid flowing into the top of the crystal like water into a vase. Once I visualised it as full, I mentally and physically sealed it by winding the wire into a clasp (so I can hang it round my neck if needed) and placed hot wax from the candle around the top of the crystal and cage. I then keep it in my hands until my incense stopped burning and said ""So mote it be.""

I'm really pleased with how it came out. It's currently sitting on my altar for inspection by the ethereal beings that visit and then I will seal it away safely until winter. I plan to access the energy by pressing the base point against my skin and meditating on it.",spells

Midsummer Rituals,26,hbkip5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hbkip5/midsummer_rituals/,1,1592535227.0,"Every year at Midsummer witches gather around their bonfires.  This is one of the most ancient of festivals - possibly the one that was first ever observed by ancient man, and still has the same magick and pull today as it ever did.

Witches of the light (as to those who worship the Old One) would offer up thanks to the great Goddess of the sun, praising and thanking her for setting the sun on its annual path so that the seasons pass in their order.   Wiccans/Neo-Pagans know her as Litha but I have always known her by the ancient Anglo Saxon name of Fritha, guardian of the sun and one of the twelve great Earth Spirits. 

For further enlightenment on this years festival you could watch this short video [https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4](https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4) As a fourth generation witch - whilst growing up, I thought bonfires at dawn, halloween rituals and Yule logs a plenty was perfectly normal, just part of our yearly celebration.  It is only with age comes hindsight!

Because each midsummer falls at a slightly different time, there are different spells that come to pass due to the alignment of the stars.  Midsummer‚Äôs eve falls on the 19th June with the sun reaching its ‚Äòstopping point‚Äô at 1.04pm (UK time - and in Devon) on the 20th June.  So this year it proceeds the suns move into Cancer, which has considerations for the hearth, happiness and the home.  A spell therefore at Midsummer asking Fritha to bless the hearth and home with happiness, will slowly build until its fruition on 30th December 2020 - the suns next show in Cancer.",spells

Is it true for benefits you gain from spell you often take something away from another person?,2,h9s8kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h9s8kg/is_it_true_for_benefits_you_gain_from_spell_you/,2,1592294923.0,"I was told by a veteran witch to be careful about spellcasting because every benefit you get be it gaining a suitcase of luggage or having sex with a gorgeous girl and gaining physical strength all come from somewhere else (often indirectly stealing from another person). For example if you cast a money spell and found $50 on the ground in the next day............. That $50 was probably lost by someone while he or she was traveling. It didn't just pop out of thin air. For all we know  the person was a girl who needed that cash to get  taxi fare home. Because she somehow lost that 50 bucks as a result of the spell, she had to travel home. She could have been grabbed from behind, dragged to the bushes, and raped. Or she could have slipped and fallen on broken glass and hurt. If nothing dangerous happens at all, she still has to walk home. Maybe she gets lucky after she realizes she has no fare when she attempts to call for a nearby Taxi in traffic but her brother happens to also be in the same traffic line and sees her and calls on her to just join him and save cash. Whatever the results, she still lost $50.

A more worldly example can be seen by a quote the witch sent me in the chatroom.

>If I see a gorgeous girl on a street corner, and want to go do some kind of work to cause her to run over and sleep with me, the butterfly effect is in play. Let's say she does immediately run over to me.

>Let's say there is a man driving a car through the intersection who normally would have slowed to look at the girl, but since I tilted the machine, she isn't there. The guy coming the other way that runs the red light would have missed this man if she were there, but since she isn't, there is a horrific, T-bone wreck. The car rolls. It badly injures both drivers, and brutally kills an innocent 4 year old girl right in front of her mother, just for being on the sidewalk.

>How much of that is my fault? I didn't run the red light, I didn't tell the mother and daughter to go for a walk... The LHP answer is it wouldn't be my fault, because everyone is just doing their thing and shit happens. My answer is a good chunk is my fault. I didn't run the red light, but I tilted the fucking machine because I knew how and just wanted something for myself, and most people are stuck just playing with the 2 bottom paddles. If I hadn't done that, there would be no accident. I also know what I am doing, I know tilting the machine is unfairly slanting things in my favor, and that makes a higher standard apply to me. I know what I am doing and I know better.

BTW the witch is actually female but she was using the above example to me since I'm a guy to help me understand better how an innocent spell like finding a friend with benefits can have devastating consequences lol!

But still is what she warns against a legitimate part of sorcery and a basic functioning of spellcasting? For example if I'm having bad health issues because of old age and cast a spell and a week later I somehow regain my youthful athleticism, was that bodybuilder energy taken from someone else,probably a young guy in the military? As a result he fails PT and gets discharged, meaning he loses his house and his family suffers as a result with his kids starving and homeless?

I am very curious and her warning is why I am hesitate to do spellcasting right now! How true is her statement?",spells

Him and I, after not being able to contact each other for two years due to her, start to talk to each other out of the blue either March 12th or 14th. We decide to meet up in person and we have a full in-depth conversation about everything and we both still admit that we love each other.

Fast forward to this weekend we've been maintaining a ""friends with benefits"" sort of dynamic despite me really wanting to try something with him again. We still tell each other we love each other, perform intimate acts, etc. However, he wants to remain single for a while due to the trauma he faced. Totally understandable.

&#x200B;

With that being said, I had asked if he would ever want to try again and he said he wasn't sure right now but he's hopeful. Is there a spell I could perform that helps aid/speed up the healing process for him emotionally and mentally all while having him turn to me and be with me?

Step 1: Ensure that you have cleared all negative energy from your pendulum.  If you are unsure how to do this, then the best start is to wash your pendulum in spring water, dry with cotton.  Place in the sun to heal for an hour, then carry about your person for a further couple of hours to align with your own energy.

Step 2: Place yourself in a room free from drafts and  make sure that fans are off/windows closed

Step 3: Make sure you know what your yes/no swings are.  If in doubt ask questions where the answer is definitely a yes/no, i.e. Am I a cat? Do I have blue eyes? Then you can verify your yes no swing. 

Et Voila! You are now in a position to ask your questions - my latest trick is to find out if dogs are pregnant and how many puppies they will have.  

These, of course are the most basic of tips, for further in depth views watch my vid [https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg](https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg) which will give you a quick start guide in under 10 mins for the pendulum.",spells

Am I cursed with Lycanthropy?,3,gwtvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwtvjp/am_i_cursed_with_lycanthropy/,15,1591345408.0,"Greetings, reddit. As you can see, my post is going to be a weird one, that's why I made a completely new reddit account, I never told anyone about what happens to me and there are close people that are checking my main reddit account and I don't want them to find about this yet. Also, English is not my native language so expect some spelling mistakes here and there. I have no idea who I can ask about this stuf honestly...

I never believed in paranormal stuff or curses but I can't ignore what's been happening for the past few years. I know I am not yet very convincing but hear me out, I am genuinely scared and paranoid. Every once in a while, I wake up in the morning really sweaty finding my blankets and pillows all thrown on the floor of my bedroom. I usually sleep naked but there were times when I didn't sleep naked and woke up with my tee either very enlarged (like when you try to pull the collar apart but you fail tearing your t-shirt) or torn.

Sometimes I even find food thrown away in random spots in my flat and the door of the fridge open and everything inside watery (I once had to buy another fridge as the old just stopped functioning properly). My neighbours that live in the same apartment block sometimes think that I am moving doing my workouts or dancing in the middle of the night as they can hear loud bumps coming from my flat (that only happens in the nights prior to these weird mornings) . I'm ashamed to say that sometimes I even find urine marks in the corners.

Another neighbour that is on the same level as me once threw a party in his flat and when people went past my door sometimes they would hear 'a dog growling but not barking' . When he told me that I couldn't control my emotions and I had a cringe-worthy reaction as I am usually a very anxious person and I can't just make up lies without shaking when I'm telling them, let alone when I am face to face with a person that I have to suddenly lie to. I just told him that I had to look after my girlfriend's dog in the end, but it was still weird and he didn't tell me anything about any growling since. (My girlfriend is studying in a different city, close to mine as we're both uni students and she's coming to my place from time to time).

But another old lady that is also my neighbour and leaves at the first level of my block said that the stray dogs from outside bark most of the night. (I know that they do that only or at least mostly when the episodes occur because I meet her in the mornings when I go to uni walking her dog and she always tells me to be careful because there can still be aggressive stray dogs around from last night).    I've considered that I might be sleep walking, but I've never been sleeping walking in my entire life and I never knew how I could check if I am.

I've considered having night-surveillance cameras, but there are multiple issues here: 1. My parents still buy stuff for me and that fridge was also expensive. They usually have to know what I need money for.                        2.  I could use my phone or just a regular old camera that can film, but they don't have a night-view mode and they can just run out of battery. I've got an iPhone and it's screen just locks automatically after a minute. Even if I disable that feature, iphones really run out of battery really fast, I tried filming for half an hour and its battery was dead afterwards.                       3. I am scared of what I would see. Even if it's just sleepwalking. I've seen other videos of that with people just talking in their beds with their eyes open and that was still creepy. Let alone me growling, pissing and doing all that mess when I never ever done that in my life (I casually asked my parents at one point if I used to sleepwalk when I was really young and they said that I didn't).

Obviously, I've seen a lot of stories/myths about lycanthropy and I was really creeped out. I am curious if you guys believe in such things. These episodes don't happen regularly (and yes, without exaggerating, they did happen on full-moon nights as well).

I am curious about your opinions. Am I way too paranoid? I've only anonymously asked a witch from my country about her opinion on my issue and she suggested I may be a werewolf and since then I'm paranoid and there's just anxiety everytime I try to sleep.

I tried making this post as easy to read so possible. Feel free to ask for more details. It's the weirdest thing in my life and I genuinely don't know who I can ask about this. Thank you for your time!

EDIT: I really appreciate your answers! I am still looking for more opinions before I make a decision regarding this issue. I'll be honest with myself and you guys.",spells

I don't want a love spell. Read the whole post, I don't want him back, it would never work. Stop sending me messages about it.

So I don't want to dump all my laundry in this post, but the story is that, when I was in high school, I had a boyfriend who I deeply adored. He was wonderful, so sweet and kind, my best friend and I loved him. The problem was, I'm aromantic (which means that I don't experience romantic attraction to anyone), although I didn't yet know it at the time. So I knew that I loved him, but it wasn't in the same way that he loved me. It started to cause friction between us, and I eventually had to break up with him. We graduated the next year and I haven't seen him since. It's been about five years and I still think about him a lot.

I carry around a lot of guilt and emotional baggage because of the whole situation. I miss him so much, but I also don't want to intrude on his life by seeking him out again because I know I hurt him, and what would be the point, anyway? It's not like we could just get back together, because I'm aromantic and he's not. He deserves someone who can love him the way he loved me.

I know spells aren't a cure-all, but I really hope there's something that might help, maybe even just to point me in the right direction to let go and heal. Can anyone help?",spells

My ex recently broke up with me because I was going through a lot in my life at the moment such as my mom being sick and starting a new job. Therefore, I was very distant with him and less affectionate. We'd only just started dating when all this occurred, so I didn't get to tell him how much these things were affecting me and why I was being so distant because he blocked me almost immediately after breaking up. But I'm in a much better place now, and I'm ready to start a relationship with him again.

So I'm looking for advice on how to cast a communication spell or something to get him to unblock me and open up to me and allow me to message him the situation I was in and why that was causing me to be so distant in hopes that he'll give me another chance. Thank you!!

I had a tarot reading with a spiritual reader. He not only reads tarot cards but he can feel energies and communicate with spirits. 

During my reading we discussed many things about my life which was pretty positive until I asked about a specific member of my childrens family. He told me that she had been doing witchcraft against me and he immediately said yes (i didn‚Äôt want to know what exactly just how to protect myself). This was obviously worrying but made sense as there had been somethings happening that I couldn‚Äôt explain before.


He told me in order to protect myself I needed to get a doll that resembled me, an amethyst crystal, rosemary and cut my nail or hair and put them all together in a small black drawstring bag. I would have to sleep with this bag under my pillow for seven days. On the seventh day I would need to bury it until a plant or something that would eventually grow roots under it which would form this protection. 

On the seventh day I went to bury it. But found myself in a situation. The place I had gone to bury it was in my community garden but I was not expecting anyone to be there as I‚Äôd gone in the night. There was a woman there that refused to let me be there as she believed I didn‚Äôt live there even though I did. A man then came to kick me out. He pushed me and the woman spat on me on top of many insults like hoping I would get coronavirus. It was terrible. I had not had an experience like this since I was child and it was a quite traumatic. I believe this was a spiritual attack. Why would this happen on a day I was supposed to finalise this protection spell? 

Anyways I left, found somewhere else to bury it and then went home. The next day it rained so I felt like it was a good sign, the plant was given something to help it grow over.

After two days I went back to where I‚Äôd buried it to check on it and I noticed a hole where the bag was. Someone had taken it. I cannot believe it. Who would do this? And why? Especially after seeing the contents surely they would just put it back? But no. It had completely disappeared and I could not see it anyway in the area. I felt shaken and afraid that someone could do something bad with it which would directly affect me. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly for days. I also couldn‚Äôt get into contact with the reader either so it‚Äôs fair to say I‚Äôve been worried ever since. 

Please can someone advice me on what to do next?

Should I leave it alone?

Should I do the ritual again?

Should I do something else?

I would really appreciate any positive answers as I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone in my life about this as the people around me would not approve of this.

Spell to lift a possible curse from old boss that gaslit and sexually harassed me?,26,g1ldjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/g1ldjf/spell_to_lift_a_possible_curse_from_old_boss_that/,7,1586955593.0,"I have a suspicion that an old manager cursed me at some point within the last year and a half. While I‚Äôve been battling with depression for years, I feel like it‚Äôs gotten worse, and aggravated Even more so by a streak of life altering bad luck. This woman talked about using chaos bb magic and working with Hecate before, and actively bragging about cursing people (I‚Äôm sure she has some hellish karma), and I don‚Äôt trust her, for this reason and that she tried to take advantage of me while I was her intern. When  told her managers what happened, she immediately got fired.
I‚Äôve looked at some spells already but if I actually have been cursed for 2 years, I would prefer to get guidance from those that are much more experienced.

I‚Äôm a beginner, but I‚Äôve been suspicious for a while. If anyone could help suggest some deep cleansing spells for curses, and hopefully spells for clearing my own energy and clarity on my path, it would mean the world. I know the second is a big ask but I‚Äôm honestly also scared that I‚Äôve let negativity fester in me so long that now I‚Äôm this mass of toxic energy?
I have nothing but time in my hands so happy to do long term spells, I just may have to utilize alternative materials since money is tight.

Honey Jar Advice,11,fvdqbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fvdqbg/honey_jar_advice/,3,1586121847.0,"I was on another forum and someone suggested I try a honey jar because I'm new to spellcasting and they can have powerful effects in heightening someone's attraction. I won't get into the back story, but I made my jar last week. I used Google for my information (again at the suggestion of someone on the other forum, and because you know...quarantine) and put in honey, my paper with our names in crosses and my affirmation in a circle around it, and part of his old toothbrush. I did not have access to an ""actual"" candle so I lit a birthday candle which was red and white intertwined (I read online that white can be used for any purpose and the candle itself doesn't matter). When the candle burned down the wick had tied into itself like a pretzel knot so I thought that was a good sign. I put the jar in my basement and was going to forget about it.

Doing more research the next day it says you should work on the jar either for 7 days or every M W F until the effects start to become apparent. I also read that if you want to sweeten the attraction further you can add cinnamon and vanilla to the jar. There seemed to be mixed reviews online as to whether to open a jar or not after sealing it, so I went with my gut and opened it to add the extra ingredients. After adding the extra ingredients I lit a new red candle that I bought at the store. This candle is one of those thicker taller circle ones that burns slow and doesn't drip. I dressed it in honey, vanilla, cinnamon, and rose oil before lighting it. I did my meditation and stated my affirmation again as I had done the first night. The candle burns so slow I figured I can burn it down over the 7 day period. I find myself sitting and meditating while it burns from anywhere from 1-3 hours a night. The candle is about halfway down now. 

After the second night of burning someone I don't know sent me a random picture of my target online. It was completely unprovoked and the sender did not know that I know his friend (target). I know that is one of the signs that the jar is working (they say you randomly run into your target places, communication picks up, whatever it may be). Since I am starting to see minimal effects should I put the jar back into my basement once the candle finally finishes burning down? How often should I be working on my jar and am I overworking it right now because I unintentionally chose a slow burning candle? I know honey jar spells are slow to work but how long should I wait before deciding my spell is or isn't working effectively? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. There is so much mixed information on Google and the last thing I want to do is incorrectly cast a spell.",spells

I thought I'd share with you guys!

What you need (but keep in mind ingredients are always adjustable if needed, due to availability or allergies):

Sunwater - For energy and motivation

Tea - To serve as your base. I used a cup of black tea for energy

Vanilla - Helps restore lost energy (You could even use vanilla tea)

Caraway - To enhance mental powers and memory

Rosemary - For good memory, clear thinking, concentration, and to repel negativity

Strawberry - To increase favorable circumstances, success, and good fortune


Using the sunwater, brew your tea and add the rest of the ingredients. I just opened the tea bag and poured in about half a teaspoon of dried rosemary and caraway seed to make straining easier, and added a piece of chopped strawberry to the water along with a couple of drops of vanilla extract. State the intent for each ingredient as you add them, and then let the tea steep. 

Once it's done, strain and add sugar if you want--sugar is used to attract in the same way that salt is used to banish--and stir clockwise as you charge it with your intent; you can be more broad or more narrow. For me it's ""I'll do great in all of my classes this semester"", and since that's quite broad, I'll probably be repeating this ritual regularly. But you could also do something like ""I'll ace that final exam"" or ""I'll make an A on that research paper"", etc. I also hold my hand over the cup and let the stream wet my fingers, which I then use to annoint myself on my forehead. This is a perfect spell to perform in the morning before you get to work, because of its energizing and motivating qualities :)",spells

This is a Ritual I have created and use daily, the Ritual took a little bit of structural inspiration from the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, however it must be made clear; 

	THIS IS NOT A BANISHING RITUAL. THIS IS NOT AN ADAPTATION OF THE LBRP, SIMILAR ONLY IN STRUCTURE. 

This Ritual is designed for daily use, its purpose is to 'Actualise' the self for the day, to realise and understand that you are part of nature, that you are of the Earth, and have a lot of potential. It is a ritual to be done daily, upon waking and bathing, it can be used as a confidence booster, a motivator, an invocation of energy, and awaking your own energy, power raising, and as intended; for Self Actualisation (realising the power you possess). A seizing the day ritual if you will. 

	Things needed:

	Something to represent the four elements, for e.g:

	1 bowl of water (Water - West) 

	1 stick of incense (Air - North) 

	1 bowl of salt or stones (Earth - East) 

	1 lit candle or dagger (South - Fire)

Now set up the elemental symbols on the floor in their respected positions. I am using a statue of a raven to represent the Air, and a plant to represent the Earth. Position them so that you are in between them, with enough space to move around.
Bathe and be present in clean clothes, or naked. Light the candle. 

Power Raising/Self-Actualization

Enter the space you have made with the symbols of the elements and face the East, in the direction of Earth. 

Touch your forhead with the index finger of your right hand and take a moment to calm the mind. Visualise stardust, the dust and rocks and atoms in space that formed the planets, and the stars, imagine this multicoloured crystal energy; this divine stardust forming everything; space, planets, galaxies, etc. Visualise this power forming the self, swirling around you (you as a person) and realise what you know to be true; that you are of the Earth. 

When the visualisation is strong, vibrate the words ""Alive"" and ""Awake"", do this in one breath for each word; like this:
	
	""AAAALLLLL - IIIIIIIIIVVVVE""

Next breath:

	""AAAAAAA - WAAAAAAAKE""

Now point your right hand to the sky and your left to the ground (similar to the symbolism of The Magician Tarot Card, of the Arthur Edward Waite Deck) and form that pose. Now visualise even more strongly this stardust, now it is coming from the ground into the left hand, and from the sky into the right hand, feel it. You are a catalyst of Magick, magick is you. Know again that you are of the Earth, a part of this world, a part of nature. 
Now vibrate these words while visualising: 

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""

Say it like this; 
	first breath equals 

	""IIIIIIIII - AMMMMM - OOONNNNNE"" 

Second breath equals

	""ONNNNNNNE - ISSSSS - MEEEEE"" 

Third beath equals

	""AALLLLLLL - ISSSSSSSSSS - ONNNNNNNNE"" 

What is being done here is what I like to call Self-Actualisation, also the visualisation is being vocalised; that the self (you) are the same divinity of the world around us, 'you' are one and one is all. Continue the visualisation of the Divine power moving through you, until you see it and feel it strongly. Know you are a part of nature, and of power.

Now, still facing East. Slash through the air like a knife of strong winds. And vibrate:

	""Mighty as wind"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""MIIIIIGHT - YYYYY - ASSSSS - WIIIIIIIIND"" 

Then say:

	""As strong as the hardest winds, but I am a gentle breeze"" 

Draw a pentegram with your hand in the air, within the pentegram, visualise the space and stars, and multicoloured crystal energies, the same space and stars from earlier. 
	
Now put the hands together in a prayer like position and visualise absorbing bright yellow energy coming from the depth of space. When satisfied with strong visualisation, Bow, then turn to the South. 

Facing South. Punch forward directly, like a directed flame. Vibrate:

	""Fierce as Flames"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""FIIIII - ERRRRRRRCE - ASSSSS - FLAAAAAAMMES"" 

Then say:

	""Fierce as a directed fire and warm as the brightest flame""

Repeat the pentegram, imagine the space, the Divine energies, space and stars flowing within and around, 
Hands as before, prayer like and visualise. This time the energy you are absorbing is bright red energies from inside the pentegram, from the vastness of space. Allow this red energy to fill you up. Bow, then turn towards the West. 

Facing West. Lift arm up, like throwing heavy waves. And vibrate:

	""Soul of the Waves"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""SOOOULLLLL - OFFFF - THEEEEE - WAVVVVVES"" 

Then say:

	""Mighty as the grandest wave and calming as the sea"" 

Again, repeat the pentegram and visualisation of deep space within it, the Magickal multi coloured crystal like energy. 
Now hands in prayer position again, visualise absorbing beautiful blue energies from the depth of space, from within the pentegram, allow this blue to fill you. Bow, and turn towards the North. 

Facing North. Tense the arm to symbolise the strength of the earth. Vibrate:

	""Steadfast as Earth"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""STEEEAADD - FAAAST - ASSSSS - EARRRRRTH"" 

Then say:

	""Steadfast as Earth and the body of all life"" 

Again repeat the pentegram and visualisation of the Divine energy and space, hands in prayer position, visualise absorbing wondrous green energies this time, from the depth of space. 

Turn back towards the East. Visualise all the different colours and energies flowing all around you and through you. 
Again, repeat The Magician Pose and absorb all these energies, allow them to crash around you, into you, you are brimming with the power of the elements, now just like before, repeat these earlier vibrations:

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""
	(While in The Magician Pose) 

Then touch forhead and vibrate:

	""Alive"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

	""Awake"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

Stomp right foot or ring a bell to conclude. 

You are now self actualized and ready for all, aware of the power you possess. 

	NOTE: ALL PENTAGRAMS DRAWN SHOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR, BE IT A BEAUTIFUL BLUE OR BLINDING WHITE. THEY ARE INVOKING PENTAGRAMS.

"Energy Work to help you in the COVID ""panic""",40,fjl6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjl6pq/energy_work_to_help_you_in_the_covid_panic/,0,1584395147.0,"An ER nurse in the r/energy_work forum asked what she can do to help deal with both the medical dangers, but also the dark and panicky energy she's surrounded by during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to share my ideas here too, in case any of you are worried or affected.  


\*\*\*  
If you can wear a quartz crystal then put it into a bowl of salt every time you go home and take it off, that will help. You can also wear hematite, tiger eye, sunstone, and obsidian. I know  that a necklace may not be allowed in the ER but even an ankle bracelet would help. Just have the stones on your person somewhere. All those stones do well to absorb negativity. To add in positive mood energy, wear or carry amethyst and rose quartz.

Next, I know you won't want to wear TOO much perfume, but if you can put some lavender oil, calendula (marigold) oil, and citrus essential oil on your pulse points, that would help.Consider dressing your helper stones and crystal with that oil as well.

On your break, go outside if you can and put your back against a stone or tree. Even a stone or brick wall can help. Feel yourself ""melting"" into the tree or stone. Feel the calm stable strength of it. Let energy reach down into the earth along with the tree roots or the foundation of the wall or stone. Let your energy extend up out of your fingertips like branches. To an outsider it will just look like you raise up your arms and have a good stretch so don't be embarrassed what others may think.Take a deep breath in through your nose and just push/dump/drain all the energy in your body down through your feet into the ground. Then take another breath and breathe in fresh energy, pulling it down from the sky and the clouds and the air. Do that 3 times total. If you know how to shield, then finish by putting your auric shields back up.

The next thing I do is sit in a few minutes of meditation while charging my stones and magickal tools. I imagine a roaring hot campfire, too hot to sit next to. I feel the heat on my face and hands, I see the flickering light. I hear the wood popping and snapping in the flames and the rush of the hot air rising, the low roar of the fire. I try to smell the good spicy musky woodsmoke scent.

It's ok to use a candle, a fireplace, or just a video of a campfire, to help visualize. Then I imagine myself being hollow and light, as if my bones were hollow conduits. And I ""reach out"" energetically and pull that campfire into me. As if my belly was the fireplace and my chest and throat and head were the chimney. I sit there for a few minutes and try to become fire. 

This is AMAZING for your immune system. I have a stage IV terminal cancer and after multiple rounds of chemo my oncologist keeps saying ""I have no idea how your white blood cell count and platelets and hematocrit look this good with the chemo cocktail you are on, but whatever you're doing just keep doing it.""  


A similar meditation is to lie looking up into the starry night sky and feel yourself drifting up into it. Drift among the stars, then drift over to one. Feel the incredible power of the giant furnace of the star, then pull it into yourself and have a hot yellow-white sun burning inside your 3rd chakra, in your belly. You can even do a galaxy! That's less good for immune system, but good for protection, and great for grabbing a huge pile of energy to use to create a reality or heal others.   


Using the same technique, toss a mint bath bomb down in your shower and stand under the coolest temperature water that still feels good. Become waterfall. Become crashing waves. This is good for clearing out emotional energy that doesn't belong to you.  


All day at work, every time things get crazy, take one second to just \*feel\* that fire in your lower chakras roar up, like throwing a log on a campfire.

Learn the Cho Ku Rei symbol. Pull a ball of that fire energy into your hand and sneakily draw the symbol on anything that needs some darn powerful healing, fast. You can also google and learn the Se He Ki symbol and draw it anytime you feel in danger or on anything that seems to need protection. You don't need to be attuned to Reiki energy in order to use those symbols - they work fine to direct ANY healing energy.

Consider hopping into r/ReikiPractitioners and asking if you could be given Reiki attunements. It CAN be done even from a distance on a video call, in some traditions. Energy healing disregards physical distance in many ways. Reiki could do a lot to protect you, and also to save patients that might otherwise not do as well. I like to think of Reiki as that one small weight on the scale to tip the balance - if you're kinda getting sick, but your immune system is also kinda fighting it off, Reiki is SO GOOD at giving things that little ""shove"" so you fight off a cold instead of catching it.  And similar situations. If a person is in the balance, and they 50/50 might make it, or might not, Reiki is the energy work ""tool"" needed there IMO.",spells

What do do when feeling irritable and drained?,29,fhqqsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fhqqsc/what_do_do_when_feeling_irritable_and_drained/,2,1584087967.0,"Someone in my energy work & reiki subreddit asked this question; what can you do with magic and energy work, when you feel drained and irritable all the time - how can you use energy to help with that?  


 I wanted to share my answer here too since I think it's a good question - and hopefully you guys will share ideas so I can pass them on to my friends over at r/energy_work

\*\*\*  


Go outside and stand with your back against a tree, and with your energy, copy what the tree's energy is doing. If you don't sense energy at that detailed level yet, visualize that the bark is melting and letting you melt into the tree trunk. Feel your toes dig into the dirt like roots, imagine white root-shaped lines of energy sinking down into the dirt. Raise your arms and stretch up, feel your fingers extend into long branched green tendrils of energy.

Also be aware that just like physical irritation, emotional irritation is a sign that something in your environment is being unhealthy and toxic. If you kept breaking out in a weird rash, you hopefully would not ignore it! You'd go searching for the cause, then get it out of your diet or body or environment. Same with mental/emotional irritation.

It's often overwork and burnout - but putting up with energy vampire type people is a common trigger too. Energy vamp types don't always make you feel BAD - heck, they can be really exciting fun people, just very draining and tiring if you have to deal with them for hours/days. A narcissist in your life can be worse than an actual energy vamp, so [r/narcissism](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/) or similar subreddit might be a place to check and see if you know anyone like that.

If you just cannot get rid of the cause, because it's a person who is too deeply part of your life, then there's things you can do. Shield, shield, shield. Learn to make yourself the energy equivalent of a tank :) Plenty of how-to's out there on that, so I won't duplicate it here. 

Also, grounding. Learn to ground so deep that you feel a hurricane would just make you sway a bit. Again, it's not the method you use, it's how much and how often you practice. Every spare moment. A martial arts teacher once told me ""if you're waiting in line, waiting in a lobby, wherever, you get your feet into one of the stances you've been taught, and practice moving forward correctly in that stance as the line moves up. It can be waiting time, or free practice time; your choice."" 

When shielding, centering, grounding, and raising energy is what you're constantly practicing, it's also helping you feel better on many levels. Plus, practicing it in odd locations means if you ever need to use it in a really sketchy or scary situation, you're used to being in public and around others, so it won't distract you.

Every time you're bored in a waiting room or a line, this is time to practice energy work drills. I've met some friends at festivals and events that way too. ""I promise I'm not on drugs, I just wanna ask, why are you doing that with your aura?"" Is one of the most memorable ways anyone has ever introduced themselves to me :)

Another spell I like to do is ""gifting"" - every emotion and energy is useful somewhere, sometime, to someone. So, I like to make a glyph or rune that represents my ""unwanted"" emotion, then infuse that glyph with a big ol ball of my emotion and offer it up to the universe as a gift to anyone who currently needs that emotion. I watch it drift away like a soap bubble and I try to imagine a situation where that emotion would be helpful and healing to someone. Even feeling irritable as heck... well, somewhere, there's a person with saint-like patience being taken advantage of by a lazy spouse, for example. It would do them \*good\* to get fed up and give the lazy one an real earful, for once.

If nothing else, doing that energy work and visualization helps me make peace with the emotion - sometimes even decide ""Hey, I kinda wanna keep it, and let it actually \*do\* it's job in my life right now.""",spells

Powerful Cleansing Ritual: the Egg Cleanse,145,ehy54r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ehy54r/powerful_cleansing_ritual_the_egg_cleanse/,16,1577797032.0,"A surprisingly powerful way to cleanse yourself of curses, energy leeches, hexes, negative energy and by some counts physical ailments, the egg cleansing ritual has been used in magick from Latin America to Italy to Romania.

The basic idea is that you rub an egg over the subject's body and the egg absorbs all negative energies off the subject.   
 You can do this to yourself, other people or animals.  

If you want, you can then break the egg into a glass of water, wait a bit, and then can tell exactly what negative magickal effects (if any) were affecting the subject prior to the cleanse.  

There are several different versions; Google can direct you to other variations if you don't like mine.  

Here's what I do:

Get one ordinary egg, a white candle, copal or frankincense incense, a heavy pinch of salt, and spring water (or holy water) in a glass.

CANDLE

Light the white candle.  It represents purity and cleanness.  If you believe in deity, make a short prayer asking your deity for their assistance.  

WATER

If you don't have holy water, make another short prayer asking the deity to bless the spring water.  If you don't believe in deity, spend several moments centering yourself and then visualize the spring water becoming especially pure and filled with power over negativity.

INCENSE

Light the incense.  Pass the egg through the smoke a few times, knowing that with each pass the egg is being transformed into a psychic sponge capable of absorbing an astonishing amount of negative energy.  

EGG

Dip your fingertips into the holy water and splash them onto the egg.  You're blessing the egg to have even more power to absorb and contain negativity.

CLEANSE

Starting at the top of the subject's head, begin rubbing the subject's body with the egg, the way you would use a sponge to clean dirt off of them.  Be methodical and diligent, focusing on the cleansing process during the entire procedure.  Cover every inch of the body--arm pits, etc., steadily moving from the head to the feet.

Some websites recommend using a sweeping motion, but I mainly use small circular motions as that's how I scrub dirt away.  Many websites instruct you to not touch the body with the egg, just running it through the subject's aura.  My intuition has always led me to make physical contact.  Follow your intuition for such details.  

**If the egg breaks during the ritual:**  there was so much negativity one egg wasn't sufficient to contain it all.  Dispose of the mess in the toilet as described under ""DISPOSAL"" below (use toilet paper to clean up the mess), bless another egg with incense and water and continue where you left off.

When done, ask the subject if there are any areas you missed or that they would like you to revisit for some extra attention.

(If you go the physical route, don't be a perv--if you aren't doing your own or your lover's body, hand the egg to the subject when it's time to do the butt, groin, etc.)

If you evoked deity earlier, thank them for aiding your working.

DIVINATION (Optional)

When you're done, crack the egg open and drop the yolk and egg white into the water.  Let it sit undisturbed for 30 minutes.  Don't worry, the holy water will contain the negativity.  Dispose of the egg shell however you normally do--the negativity passed through the shell without sticking to it.

After 30 minutes, use the interpretation guide below to interpret the egg yolk and egg white to see what negativity was removed from the subject.

DISPOSAL

Pour the egg and holy water into the toilet, toss in the salt (which neutralizes energy, an extra safety precaution) and then flush the toilet, removing the negativity from the subject and you forever.  

**--- INTERPRETATION GUIDE ---**

There are some minor differences between different interpretation guides.  Which you use doesn't matter.  What matters is that you decide which you're going to use before you begin.  That way the spell can align the omens to the interpretation you'll use.

Study the egg in the water and look for the following:

**Small bubbles:**  negative energy (e.g. residual negative emotional energy) was successfully removed.

**Web or mesh pattern:**  negative energy that was explicity entrapping you was removed.

**Pointy shapes, like pins or nails, pointing up:**  envious people are working against you, but not using magick; their energy was removed.

**Pointy shapes, like pins or nails, pointing down:**  your own negativity was working against you; the negativity was removed but could reappear if the negativity persists.

**An eye pattern:**  the effects of the evil eye were removed.

**Blood spots or streaks:**  a (non-demonic) negative spirit's influence was removed, e.g. an energy leech.

**Black spots or streaks:**  a curse, hex or jinx was removed.

**Murky water without blood or black spots:**  the subject has experienced significant soul loss, and a shamanic journey for healing should be considered.

**Foul smell:**  powerful negative magick was removed.

**Sulfur smell:**  a demon was harrassing the subject.

**The yolk is floating halfway down:**  someone is working negative magick of moderate strength against you.

**The yolk is floating at the top of the water:**  someone is working negative magick of powerful strength against you.

**A face-like shape can be seen:**  an enemy is working against you.  Traditionally, slim faces indicate men and rounded faces indicate women.

**None of the above:**  there wasn't anything particularly negative for the egg to remove.",spells

To make the work day go faster (try not to look at the clock too often after saying it and for an extra boost, repeat to yourself or out loud several times throughout the day 'I can't believe how fast the day's going' or 'wow. It's already lunchtime or whatever time'):

'Time flies when you're having fun.

Let the time fly by so fast.

So that this work day will not last.'

'Muse of art, Muse of sound, Muse of thought gather round.

Come to me with your guiding light. Guide my hand in this creative rite.

And as I call your spirits forth, so shall it be.'

&#x200B;

When I need to focus OR could use a little boost of luck (works for both...just got to set the intention):

'Right time, right place

Sacred moment, sacred space

From sky above to earth below

I am in my perfect flow.'

Simply repeat to yourself several time throughout the day:

 'Everything works out in my favor.'

A Spell to Attract Love into Your Life,71,d7tg89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/d7tg89/a_spell_to_attract_love_into_your_life/,3,1569201525.0,"Feel free to modify the following spell to suit your occult sensibilities.  For example, if you normally cast a circle, add that to the ritual.  

Get a red rose, some rose essential oil, some paper, a red pen, something to light fire with, something fireproof to burn paper on/in, and a printed photo of a deity of love and romance of your choice (e.g. Aphrodite, Cupid, etc.) if you believe in pagan deities, or a photo of a romantic couple, for example the silhouette of a couple kissing at sunset.

You're going to be performing a petition spell:

1. Set the photo of the deity (or romance) in front of you. Stare at it, letting worldly considerations fall away and focusing your mind on the magick you are about to undertake. Focus intently on what success would look like in your life.
2. Using the red pen, write what you want on the paper. Keep it down to one or a few sentences. Use sappy, romantic language, for example writing a short poem with rhyming couplets would be great. Spend time on this, write neatly, and focus intensely on your intent as you write. If you believe in pagan gods, write the name of the deity at the top of the page, as though you were writing them a letter.
3. Rub rose essential oil on the edges of the paper. Use a q-tip. Make sure the oil doesn't touch the ink (not for metaphysical reasons, just because the oil may make the ink run).
4. Silently read what you wrote over and over, using a combination of your emotion and your willpower to infuse meaning and substance into the paper. Visualize the paper becoming something more than it is on a mundane level; the more you focus your intention into the paper, the stronger it will become metaphysically.
5. Read what you wrote in a loud in a firm, projecting voice (or firm, projecting inner voice if you need to be quiet). Read it like you are making an announcement to the cosmos about what will be.
6. Light the paper with the writing on fire. Make sure it burns completely. This will release your intention into the universe, aligning the future with your goals. (And if you believe in pagan deities, supplicating their assistance as well.). Hold the rose on the fire, so that the petals smoulder, adding their energy to what's being released by the fire.
7. If you evoked deity during this ritual, express your heartfelt thanks for the help they will provide during this spell.
8. Get a snack to eat.

Edit to add: don't try this to get a specific person to fall in love with you.  Setting aside ethical considerations, spells raise finite amounts of energy; if the person doesn't love you on their own, they're just going to break up with you when the spell ends, causing you both misery, and if you try to keep it going with an endless series of spells, deep in your heart you'll know they don't actually love you for you.

It is such a better use of your magick to help you and the right someone find one another.  The spell just helps you connect; the emotions that result will be real.",spells

This is unimportant to true knowledge. Your seeking a false relationship based on a controlling factor meaning you don't even like the person you just want to control them leading to they were never a fit for you and creating a bigger problem if it works due to them not even matching up with you.

Change my mind.

Also I'd prefer to see plant energy storage spells. Breaking curses. Making wards and shields for you dwelling. Spells for hiding your street from normal view. Spells for distancing yourself from people who will manipulate your view on your main focus or goal. These should be top priority here. 

Yet love and revenge is all I see. The most fruitless battle. Love creates revenge. Can't have love without hatred. 

I know this goes against rule one and I'll take it down if this truly gets to you guys but still I'm not staying silent anymore. Finding the proper knowledge or true skills to continue in this practice are hidden from the people who need the protection the most from those who seek destruction through mental abuse of forcing fake feelings upon someone who possible wouldn't even mix well in their potion of life.

I thought I'd share with you guys!

What you need (but keep in mind ingredients are always adjustable if needed, due to availability or allergies):

Sunwater - For energy and motivation

Tea - To serve as your base. I used a cup of black tea for energy

Vanilla - Helps restore lost energy (You could even use vanilla tea)

Caraway - To enhance mental powers and memory

Rosemary - For good memory, clear thinking, concentration, and to repel negativity

Strawberry - To increase favorable circumstances, success, and good fortune


Using the sunwater, brew your tea and add the rest of the ingredients. I just opened the tea bag and poured in about half a teaspoon of dried rosemary and caraway seed to make straining easier, and added a piece of chopped strawberry to the water along with a couple of drops of vanilla extract. State the intent for each ingredient as you add them, and then let the tea steep. 

Once it's done, strain and add sugar if you want--sugar is used to attract in the same way that salt is used to banish--and stir clockwise as you charge it with your intent; you can be more broad or more narrow. For me it's ""I'll do great in all of my classes this semester"", and since that's quite broad, I'll probably be repeating this ritual regularly. But you could also do something like ""I'll ace that final exam"" or ""I'll make an A on that research paper"", etc. I also hold my hand over the cup and let the stream wet my fingers, which I then use to annoint myself on my forehead. This is a perfect spell to perform in the morning before you get to work, because of its energizing and motivating qualities :)",spells

Spell worked!,41,fk1w02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fk1w02/spell_worked/,10,1584463587.0,"So, at first I thought that I was doing something wrong, but it looks like the spell worked. It was a spell to make a specific person to notice my qualities, and I think it worked! He started calling me every day, and we talk for like an hour. Since in Italy nobody can go out, we facetime and we call each other. We use WhatsApp too. And he lives in front of my house. I really like where this is going! YAY! 
Edit: someone asked me to share the spell, so here it is! First, light a candle. Then, bring that candle in your bathroom and have a purifying bath. Keep the candle near you for about one and an half hour after the bath. Then, place your candle in your altar, and write on a little piece of paper what you want from that spell. I wrote: ""when this candle will burn down, (his name) will start seeing my qualities and my inner and outer beauty and my personality."" I folded the piece of paper, and I put it in the melting wax. You can burn it in the candle's flame, but since the spell will start when the candle burns down, the piece of paper will follow the candle burning. And that's it, let the candle burn down and keep the container, so the spell's energy will remain in your room. This started working the same day the candle consumed itself. You will notice a big change on how person acts towards you! ‚ô°",spells

"Energy Work to help you in the COVID ""panic""",43,fjl6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjl6pq/energy_work_to_help_you_in_the_covid_panic/,0,1584395147.0,"An ER nurse in the r/energy_work forum asked what she can do to help deal with both the medical dangers, but also the dark and panicky energy she's surrounded by during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to share my ideas here too, in case any of you are worried or affected.  


\*\*\*  
If you can wear a quartz crystal then put it into a bowl of salt every time you go home and take it off, that will help. You can also wear hematite, tiger eye, sunstone, and obsidian. I know  that a necklace may not be allowed in the ER but even an ankle bracelet would help. Just have the stones on your person somewhere. All those stones do well to absorb negativity. To add in positive mood energy, wear or carry amethyst and rose quartz.

Next, I know you won't want to wear TOO much perfume, but if you can put some lavender oil, calendula (marigold) oil, and citrus essential oil on your pulse points, that would help.Consider dressing your helper stones and crystal with that oil as well.

On your break, go outside if you can and put your back against a stone or tree. Even a stone or brick wall can help. Feel yourself ""melting"" into the tree or stone. Feel the calm stable strength of it. Let energy reach down into the earth along with the tree roots or the foundation of the wall or stone. Let your energy extend up out of your fingertips like branches. To an outsider it will just look like you raise up your arms and have a good stretch so don't be embarrassed what others may think.Take a deep breath in through your nose and just push/dump/drain all the energy in your body down through your feet into the ground. Then take another breath and breathe in fresh energy, pulling it down from the sky and the clouds and the air. Do that 3 times total. If you know how to shield, then finish by putting your auric shields back up.

The next thing I do is sit in a few minutes of meditation while charging my stones and magickal tools. I imagine a roaring hot campfire, too hot to sit next to. I feel the heat on my face and hands, I see the flickering light. I hear the wood popping and snapping in the flames and the rush of the hot air rising, the low roar of the fire. I try to smell the good spicy musky woodsmoke scent.

It's ok to use a candle, a fireplace, or just a video of a campfire, to help visualize. Then I imagine myself being hollow and light, as if my bones were hollow conduits. And I ""reach out"" energetically and pull that campfire into me. As if my belly was the fireplace and my chest and throat and head were the chimney. I sit there for a few minutes and try to become fire. 

This is AMAZING for your immune system. I have a stage IV terminal cancer and after multiple rounds of chemo my oncologist keeps saying ""I have no idea how your white blood cell count and platelets and hematocrit look this good with the chemo cocktail you are on, but whatever you're doing just keep doing it.""  


A similar meditation is to lie looking up into the starry night sky and feel yourself drifting up into it. Drift among the stars, then drift over to one. Feel the incredible power of the giant furnace of the star, then pull it into yourself and have a hot yellow-white sun burning inside your 3rd chakra, in your belly. You can even do a galaxy! That's less good for immune system, but good for protection, and great for grabbing a huge pile of energy to use to create a reality or heal others.   


Using the same technique, toss a mint bath bomb down in your shower and stand under the coolest temperature water that still feels good. Become waterfall. Become crashing waves. This is good for clearing out emotional energy that doesn't belong to you.  


All day at work, every time things get crazy, take one second to just \*feel\* that fire in your lower chakras roar up, like throwing a log on a campfire.

Learn the Cho Ku Rei symbol. Pull a ball of that fire energy into your hand and sneakily draw the symbol on anything that needs some darn powerful healing, fast. You can also google and learn the Se He Ki symbol and draw it anytime you feel in danger or on anything that seems to need protection. You don't need to be attuned to Reiki energy in order to use those symbols - they work fine to direct ANY healing energy.

Consider hopping into r/ReikiPractitioners and asking if you could be given Reiki attunements. It CAN be done even from a distance on a video call, in some traditions. Energy healing disregards physical distance in many ways. Reiki could do a lot to protect you, and also to save patients that might otherwise not do as well. I like to think of Reiki as that one small weight on the scale to tip the balance - if you're kinda getting sick, but your immune system is also kinda fighting it off, Reiki is SO GOOD at giving things that little ""shove"" so you fight off a cold instead of catching it.  And similar situations. If a person is in the balance, and they 50/50 might make it, or might not, Reiki is the energy work ""tool"" needed there IMO.",spells

Saturday Spell Challenge: self love spell using only one tool,39,iepnbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iepnbp/saturday_spell_challenge_self_love_spell_using/,5,1598156298.0,"We so often have questions about what ingredients to buy, tools to use, etc when it comes to spell casting, but it‚Äôs good to remember that you have everything you really need to get started already!

For this spell challenge: create &amp; share a spell for self-love and acceptance using only one magical tool (or no tools!)

For mine:

Start by taking a shower or bath to refresh &amp; renew, meditate &amp; visualize on the water cleansing you physically, and also removing any ‚Äúouter rind‚Äù built up on your mind/psyche.  Maybe you‚Äôve been having to toughen up lately, to push through fatigue at work, or have been self-medicating.  Let the water rinse away the tough outer shell you have built through these survival mechanisms.  Let the water leave you bare, naked and vulnerable, cleansed of facade and receptive to change.

Dry off, but don‚Äôt apply any moisturizers/creams/after shower routine.  Find a nice place to be alone with a mirror, behind closed doors (full length mirror is best).  Dim the lights and work by candlelight if that best sets the tone.

Cast a circle/sacred space/raise energy in the way that fits your tradition, but without using tools ‚Äî only your body, your mind, and your spiritual connections.

If you work with divine feminine or nurturing spirits, call on them at this time to work through you.

Place an oil, salve or cream that you use in your magical practice (the one tool) on the palms of your hands, rub them together slowly and open up the channel between you and your concept of the divine/spiritual mother.  Continue to work your hands until your hands are her hands and no longer your own.

Disrobe infront of the mirror, and have the courage to not look away.  Confront the parts of your body that unsettle you, scare you, or make you feel ashamed.  For each part, think about:

1) What is the nature of this feeling?

2) What are the thoughts that lead to it?

3) What external places do these thoughts come from?  Media, judgmental family members, societal norms or pressures?

Remember: your hands are now HER hands.  She is with you.  Use your hands to comfort you in the way a mother would.  If things get too intense, turn away from the mirror and re-center your mind on her presence before returning to the mirror. 

On the part of your body that you are focusing on, rub the oil into your skin, with gentle and loving motions like a mother figure would.  Call upon your nurturing spirits or divine feminine to act through your hands to bless this part of you and to remind you that it is holy, beautiful and powerful.  Trace your sacred symbols with your hands over this part, taking your time.

Apply more oil to the rest of your skin, like you would a moisturizer.  Replace the space left behind by removing your hard outer shell with the oil/salve as a renewing and protecting layer of the divine feminine.  Take a long time with this, giving extra attention where needed.

Conclude by paying extra attention on the area of your chest/heart (or where you feel the most tension).

Now, place your body in the positions of any divine poses you know, such as those depicted in statues of your tradition.  If you don‚Äôt know any, ask the divine feminine you work with to teach one to you, or create a pose that represents beauty, power, magic or motherhood.  In the mirror, realize the beauty that you have created with your own body.

At this time, do what you feel most compelled to ‚Äî close the circle, thank your spirits, journal about the experience, divine, craft, meditate more deeply on the thoughts/feelings that arose, do something that makes you feel powerful, sleep, have an ugly cry, watch the AOC makeup video ‚Äî all are valid!

Over the next few days, take some time to research depictions &amp; descriptions of divine, spiritual, mythological women through history and across cultures, such as:

Rejuvenation potion- perfect for new beginnings. 

First you need moon water charged by a waxing crescent moon for inspiration and hope. If there won‚Äôt be a waxing crescent for a few weeks use sun water instead. 
Next is bergamot oil for invigoration.
Finally, citrine for regeneration and intuition. 

First, take a cleansed crystal and hold it in your hands; channel all your positive energy and hope into the crystal. Next, I charged my moon water with a citrine crystal in the bowl. If you‚Äôre charging your water with the sun then don‚Äôt add citrine yet as the light can degrade the crystal, add the crystal to the sun water for a few hours out of direct sunlight. Remove the citrine, a few drops of bergamot oil to the water and tip it into a glass bottle (ideally with a cork). To make it look prettier I added fresh herbs to the bottle, rosemary for purification and thyme for luck. 

To use the potion I took it outside and found a sunny spot- this can be the grass, soil or even concrete. Even if it‚Äôs a dull day try to find a few moments of sunlight for the spell. Pour the potion (all of it or just a little) in a circle and sit inside it, I sat cross legged on the floor but grab a seat if you need one. Bask in the light for as long as you want to (or as long as you can if the sun hides away), I stayed for about half an hour and meditated. 

That‚Äôs it! Hope you enjoyed this and got some inspiration. How else would you use this potion? How would you change it?",spells

Manifesting With The Moon,29,j2fu9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2fu9h/manifesting_with_the_moon/,0,1601470846.0,"# Only approximately 239,00 miles away from the Earth, there is no doubt that the extraordinary, celestial mass in our night sky-- The Moon-- has powerful control over the Earth and its people.¬†

While the Sun represents masculine energy, the Moon represents the utmost powerful feminine energy. She signifies intuition, birth, death, and reincarnation and represents our hidden emotions, desires, worries, and self-work.

Spiritually, she acts as our Mama, subtly reminding her children that everything on Earth is ever-changing and follows a natural cycle. She offers us the ability to feel, nourish, learn from the past, and creatively unlock and express our authentic selves.

THE NEW MOON

The New Moon is the first phase in the Lunar cycle. It occurs when The Moon comes into direct alignment in the Sun. When the Sun becomes possessive of the Moon and he does not want to share her beauty with the Earth, we are shown emptiness representing a time for fresh starts and new beginnings. It‚Äôs time to rest and begin planting new seeds of desire and intention by writing them down. This is the time to meditate and gently breathe new life into any areas of stagnation in which you wish to thrive.

THE FULL MOON

The Full Moon follows the Waxing Gibbous. The Sun and the Moon are in harmony and the Sun reflects his brilliance off the Moon‚Äôs surface, creating her own light for us to use. This phase represents intense thoughts and powerful breakthroughs. Full moons are thought to influence humans so powerfully, there is a record of heightened emotions and even psychosis. This is the time to reflect. Allow yourself to analyze what‚Äôs working for you--or what‚Äôs not. Celebrate this realization-- this is the universe connecting with you.

Make a Mint Money Charm and Human Sacrifice?,24,i45bdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i45bdp/make_a_mint_money_charm_and_human_sacrifice/,0,1596662808.0,"Whilst creating my August Witchcraft and Make a Mint Money Charm on youtube,  I was researching the Wicker Man traditions that occur primarily in August in the UK.  

It is such a fascinating subject that i thought I would give you a little synopsis...

Wicker Man festivals have been given a bad rap by a) Julius Ceasar and b) The 1970s horror film of the same name. And I wanted to redress the balance somewhat by sharing my thoughts here. 

A wicker man was created by bending green willow branches into the shape of a man.  The shaping of willow into various forms is a well known tradition of the UK and is especially prevalent in the South West of the country (the Somerset levels is where willow grows abundantly).  All sorts of creations are made from dragons to chickens.

There is scant evidence of human sacrifice performed by druids and witches within a wicker man.  The main proposer of this method was Julius Caesar himself whilst writiing about his conquest of Gaul (remember your Asterix?) He wanted to discredit the ‚Äòpriests‚Äô (i.e. the druids) of Gaul so there was good reason for him to say they sacrificed humans.

It was most likely that the sacrifice was the wicker man itself (the use of the word man fuelling the rumours of human sacrifice), sometimes they would contain dead animals who would then be cooked in the flames and eaten at the feast afterwards.  Their blood having been spilt and poured in libation before they were placed inside.  

Human sacrifice does not appear to be part of the Druidic rituals, although we cannot say for sure either way, as it was an oral tradition, but there does not appear to be an echo in todays practices and country traditions - which is something that you would expect from such a main stream religion of old.  There are certainly other echoes (maypole dancing for example).  Do check out my video on YT for more information at: [https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8](https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8) Which has the added bonus of a Make a Mint Money Charm (get some quick cash)

That is not to say that there were not sects who did sacrifice their fellow man - but it is unlikely that this was main stream (I mean would you follow such a sect where the next victim might be you?).",spells

Situation: 

I used to live in texas and there was a dog that lived next to my boss/friends house. He was outside all the time, his shelter didn't protect him from elements well, always had fleas, owners would go days without refilling food and water. Bad situation. I befriended the dog and the owners even let me take him home for sleepovers on freezing nights sometimes. I tried to buy the dog many times and they always refused. My friend still tries to look out for him and takes him to the vet when he needs it. We agreed that if the dog ever gets out of his yard again like he sometimes does that my friend would keep him till i can drive out and get him. My last ditch effort will be to steal him, but the house has cameras, the dogs skittish and might not remember me from a year ago, its not an easy heist. My friends going to try and buy him (i'm giving him the money) since they are neighbors and gotten along and might not refuse him like me. The guy beat his wife and she moved out with the cops today, so my friend is going to offer her a couple grand for the dog. Its more likely she will sell cause she needs the money and its a fuck you to her husband. If not we have to try to go throught the husband again.

Spell to Banish Malevolent Spirits & Ward Off Bad Luck,24,dv31y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/dv31y5/spell_to_banish_malevolent_spirits_ward_off_bad/,2,1573552740.0,"(The following was originally posed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/dv0fku/does_anyone_know_any_simple_ways_to_rid_negative/) by [u/basementmagus/](https://www.reddit.com/user/basementmagus/) who learned of it via the DeSayvok Coveen of New England.  Reposted here with permission.)

On the day of a full moon, take an all-day candle outside and make a flame on it, when the sun is high above and shining down strong. Slip into a forgetting trance (A sensorium exercise to connect with the sensation of your body without mental chatter) and speak with the soul of the sun, and the soul of the flame. Ask the sun for a portion of its great and awe-full presence, and using your breath, breathe some of the sun's power into you (more on this in a minute) and breathe it out into the flame- not too hard, lest you kill the flame. Then, put that candle away in a safe and sheltered place, because that flame must be kept burning all day, to be used later that evening. It cannot go out for any reason. Any candle lit from it maintains the flame and the solar force, just in case you have to ""transfer"" the flame to another candle.

When the full moon of that day rises, take a fine silver vessel or a crystal glass vessel, or an earthen vessel full of water- clean well water works best- and sit it under the moon, shining down on it. Use your forgetting trance to speak to the soul of the moon and the soul of the water- ask the Moon, and the Terrifying and Majestic Queen Below the Earth before whom all demons tremble, to bless the water with the power to command the harmful powers of night.

Then, go inside of your house, put a nice sized hunk of fresh bread in the center of a white or yellow triangle drawn of flour, and under the bread should be a black piece of linen, or burlap, or some other dark scrap cloth, three true copper pennies next to the bread, and under that cloth, a cord- it should be black, but yellow or natural color works, too.

Walk in a clockwise circle around the area with the bread and the rest of those things at the center of it. This is best done in the main room of your home, or of the house you are working upon. Carry that Sun-flame with you, three times clockwise, and as you move, carrying this little sun, command all harmful spirits and demons and wicked powers that exist in or near this home, or who dwell in the bodies or souls of any present, or who trouble those who sleep in the home, to enter the bread and copper before you all in the name of the Soul of the Sun, the majestic power of right-turning. Tell the powers of the place that you offer this bread and copper to ransom the people who dwell in the house, and tell the powers that cause accidents and sudden strokes of ill fortune that if they are present, that they must yield to the right-turning power of the Sun and enter the bread, to feast there.

Then, place the candle down to the east, and get the water. Carry it clockwise around three times, and, as you walk, make the same commands and requests as above, except this time in the name of the Soul of the Moon, and in the Name of She Before Whom All Spirits Shake in Fear, and All Demons Tremble. Tell the powers that cause accidents and sudden strokes of ill fortune that if they are present, that they must yield to the power of the Moon and the Queen Who Holds the Keys of the World, and enter the bread, to feast there.

Then, put the water down to the west, and catch the bread and pennies up in the cloth, wrap them quick, and start ""binding"" the whole mess with the cord which should be there. Bind it around nine times if you can. Then, quick as you may, take the whole bound bundle away from the home, swiftly, and either take it to a distant crossroads, or to a running river (preferably one that runs in a direction away from the home) and either leave it at the crossroads, or toss it in the river. Walk away without looking back- if any wicked power compelled by your work ""sees"" into your eyes as you walk away, it may return easily with you- the eyes are the gateway of the soul, after all.

As it is, compelled by the Sun, Moon, and the Terrifying One, it probably won't be at liberty to just go- and the crossed roads or the river will force it away into the Unseen with great and final force. If you have neither crossed roads or a river or good stream to use, you can hang the bundle in the branches of a distant and large oak tree, or bury it in sand or mud somewhere, as far from your home as you may. A nice bog disposal never hurt, either.

I'd do this once a month, if I were you- it's more than just about spiritual protection; it's also about being protected from accidents and disasters around the home, the kinds that can kill people or maim them. The same powers that can cause accidents around the living area can follow you and cause them in the rest of the world, too. So this is an act of transference most importantly.

Likewise, I'd recommend one creating a proper ward afterwards, to protect the home, catch hostile spells and malevolent spirits, and perhaps send them back on their way. A witches bottle can do the trick, as a time tested method used in cunningcraft and witchcraft.",spells
My Dark Spell Story (a warning to all),24,dakhib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/dakhib/my_dark_spell_story_a_warning_to_all/,5,1569727197.0,"This is the story about the time I practiced black magic. let it be a warning to all those who are inexperienced and who are dabbling In the dark arts!

When I was young and I met my husband, I was extremely jealous of his ex-girlfriend. I made a Spell (which I will not give the exact details on as I do not share my spells with anyone) using dark magic to make her suffer.

You see, my husband's ex has goofy and large front teeth. My verse for the spell included a line that mentioned her teeth. I poured all of my intent and malice into this spell. I repeated three times that I wanted bad karma or bad luck to come on her x 3.

3 days went by with no sign of any change. Then on day three I started having intense toothache. it was so bad that I could not sleep and I was banging my head against the wall just to distract myself from the pain. The next morning (day two) I stumbled into the dentists office and they pulled that tooth out. Day 3 came and where the hole existed, where the tooth once was, there was a extremely painful and foul smelling infection that had set in. It was so bad that I had to go into hospital. The infection has spread to my wisdom tooth. I had to undergo surgery to remove my wisdom tooth. I thought that was the end of it. But then where they had removed my wisdom tooth another infection began to take hold. I did extreme cleansing ritual at that point. I sat in a bath of salt water and repeatedly I said a verse that was reversing the initial spell. The next morning the infection was gone and everything was back to normal.

The black magic that I had foolishly practiced had turned on me and back fired thrice! After that I learnt my lesson and I never practice in intentions in magic spells anymore.

My point of this story is to warn anyone who is starting out with magic to be very cautious and remember that there is karma for everything that you put out in this world.",spells

Spell for guilt/remorse,21,frwgd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/frwgd2/spell_for_guiltremorse/,9,1585622376.0,"I found a spell the other day to make another person feel guilty about something.

I searched on other versions of this spell and others include melting a white candle on the ‚Äúseam‚Äù of the compact mirror. Do you think that will affect the spell significantly? I‚Äôm also fairly new to this so what‚Äôs the purpose of sealing it with candle wax?

Money-Doubling Spell,21,cmknde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/cmknde/moneydoubling_spell/,9,1565086878.0," 

## Money-Doubling Spell

This is a simple spell used to double any denomination of paper money. You must have the money physically in your hands in order to cast this spell to double it.

1. First, take those fresh notes of paper money (in any denomination‚Äîthe larger the denomination, the higher the reward). You may use more than one note if you wish.
2. Place these bills in a new white envelope, then seal the envelope. Fold the envelope in half (folding towards you) and chant:  
‚ÄúPowers that be, to me shall bring,  
The means to double this sum.  
Hear me, you spirits which sing,  
Quickly, and gently come.‚Äù
3. Do this once every day for seven days. As you chant, hold the envelope up in front of you and envision the envelope getting heavier. Keep the envelope full of notes in your bedroom when you are not casting the spell.
4. After you‚Äôve received the money, open the envelope and spend or deposit the money in the envelope.

If you want to cast this spell again, you must use a new set of bills and envelope.",spells

Spell for Justice,21,axu55u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/axu55u/spell_for_justice/,3,1551871702.0,"When I feel the need to balance the scales because I feel strongly that someone has wronged me, I will use the following spell to summon justice to the situation.

The main benefit to this spell is that it is not a curse.  You aren't slinging negative mojo at someone in a fit of anger, you're just making sure all the parties involved get what they deserve, whatever that may be.  It's not wrong to inject some justice into a situation lacking it.  Karma isnt going to punish you for using this spell....

The main downside is that if you're involved in the situation, you will also be covered by the spell's results.  Attempts to get around this and make yourself exempt from the justice you are invoking is an inherently unjust act.  Karma won't smite you for using this spell.  But it might insure that you get punished if you were among the parties who treated someone unjustly.

Feel free to modify this spell to suit your own style and traditions.  For example, if you use an altar in your rituals, feel free to incorporate your alter as you see fit.  If you've got herbs you associate with justice, add them to the fire, etc.

If you come across a step that you aren't familiar with and isn't explained (e.g. casting a circle, putting your intent into paper), Google it, look at several versions and pick the version that you like best.

\----------

**Materials Needed**

Optional items/steps are just that--optional.  They all add power.  I wouldn't use them for relatively minor injustices involving few people.  The more people involved and/or the more severe the injustice, the more important the optional stuff becomes.

* Either 2 incense sticks and four candles, or 2 incense sticks and four incense cones, or 6 incense sticks.  Whatever combination you choose, all six items need to be white-floral scented (e.g. gardenia, jasmine, white roses, etc.).  These will help you draw down more Justice power into your ritual.
* An image of Justice.  This can be a deity of justice (e.g. Ma'at, Forseti, Tyr, etc.) or Lady Justice (the blindfolded lady holding scales).  This can be anything from a statue to a photo printed from the internet inside a cheap plastic picture frame.  This imagery will help focus the ritual and draw down more power.
* A sheet of pure white paper.  Standard copy paper will do.  Fancy papers like papyrus will add a little extra power to the spell if it's white.  It will absorb your energy/intent and release it upon being burned.
* Something to write with (e.g. a pen or pencil).
* Something to write on (e.g. clipboard, book, etc.)
* A lighter or matches.  (Wooden matches add a little power.)
* Something you can safely burn paper in/on.
* Optional:  white floral scented oil (e.g. gardenia essential oil).  It will increase the amount of Justice energy you draw down.
* Optional:  dried white flower petals.  They will increase the amount of Justice energy you draw down.
* Optional:  white flowers (real--not fake or silk).  They will increase the amount of Justice energy you draw down.
* Optional:  red jasper.  (If you have four pieces, put one on each corner of the paper.  If you have five pieces, arrange in a pentacle and put the paper in the middle.)  This stone is associated with Justice, and will increase the amount of power your ritual draws down.

&#x200B;

**The Ritual**

A) If you're doing this ritual inside, disable or cover your smoke detectors.  If they're wired into the building, covering them with a plastic bag held in place with a rubber band can keep smoke out of them.

&#x200B;

B) Do whatever pre-ritual steps you normally do:  aura cleansing, centering and grounding, ritual baths, etc.

&#x200B;

1) Charge the four incense/candles with intent/energy.  If you dress candles, do that now.  The intent for the four candles/incense is to create a sacred space dedicated to the god/goddess you are working with (or dedicated to the archetypal cosmic force of Justice).

&#x200B;

2) Cast a circle in your usual fashion, except mark your four corners with the candles/incense rather than the elements.  Before lighting them, charge one of the two incense sticks with energy to draw down more sacred Justice energy into the sacred space.  Hold that incense stick in your hand and light it.  Do not blow out the flame.  Insead, use the flaming incense stick like a match to light the candles/incense marking the four corners.  (Move quickly; holding the incense vertical can slow down the burn rate if necessary.)  As you light each corner, call out the name of the deity you are working with, or call out ""Justice"" in a firm voice.  Project your call: you are summoning that power into your circle.  When you are done, let the flaming incense in your hand burn itself out.  (If you're using incense in your four corners, blow them out so that they're smoking like incense is normally used.)

&#x200B;

3) Place the imagery of Justice in front of you, so that your workspace is between you and the image.

Optional:  if you're using fresh flowers, place them at the base of the imagery.

&#x200B;

4) Take a few moments to feel yourself surrounded by sacred Justice energy. Enjoy the purity and power of it.  If you're working with a deity, thank them for lending their power to your working.

&#x200B;

5) On the paper, put the name of the deity you're working with at the top of the page.  Or if you're working with the cosmic archetypal power of Justice, just put ""Justice"" at the top.

Underneath that, write a brief statement indicating what your spell will accomplish.  Write neatly, with proper punctuation, spelling and grammar.  (Decide what you want to write beforehand with proofreading software if you need to.)  Keep it simple, with just enough detail to be clear what the situation is, but do not be specific about outcomes; you aren't a God of Justice and it isn't your place in this ritual to dictate the outcome.

*An example of what you should write:*  ""May the judge overseeing my divorce case treat me and my spouse fairly and do what is best for our children.""

*An example of what you should NOT write:*  ""May the judge give me the house, car and sole custody of the kids because John is an alcoholic.""

*Another example of what you should write:*  ""May the person or people who stole my car be caught and found guilty.""

*Anothet example of what you should NOT write:*  ""May the person or people who stole my car get caught and found guilty and get the maximum sentence allowed because I lost my job, and get beat up in jail.""

(If you can't trust a deity of justice to know what's just in your situation without you micromanaging them, don't do this spell.)

&#x200B;

6) Fill the paper with intent/energy.  Draw some of the ambient Justice energy inside your sacred space for this purpose; it will make the ritual stronger.

The intent is NOT to manifest the outcome described on the paper.  The intent is to open a pathway for whatever deity/force you ware working with to flood your situation with their divine energy.  You're opening a pathway; they are shaping and directing the energy that will solve the problem.  The more intent/energy you fill the paper with, the stronger the pathway and the more divine energy you will draw down.  There are countless injustices going on in the world at any given moment; the writing on the paper simply directs the energy being drawn down toward the particular situation you want addressed.

Take your time infusing the paper with intent/energy.  A standard piece of paper can absorb a surprising amount of intent/energy.

Optional:  If you have red jasper, touch it to the paper while you do Step 6.  It will magnify the intent/energy you put into the paper.

&#x200B;

7) Optional:  annoint the edges of the paper with white floral oil.  Try not to get it on the ink; some oils can make some ink run.

&#x200B;

8) Read what you have written, loudly in a bold voice.  You are announcing to nearby spirits, the gods and the cosmos what will be.  (If you can't speak out loud for some reason, boldly project your inner voice outward so that any entity capable of hearing such thoughts, like nearby spirits, the gods and the cosmos, will hear it.)

&#x200B;

9) Optional:  if you are using dried flower petals, fold your paper in half and place the dried petals inside the folded paper.

&#x200B;

10) Charge your last remaining incense stick with more draw-down-divine-power energy.

&#x200B;

11) Light the last incense stick.  Leave it burning.  Use it like a match to set the paper on fire.  Make sure every piece of the paper burns.

If you are able to feel energy, you will feel a rush of energy which will subside as the last of the flames extinguish.  Let the energy flow through you and out of you, like you are a wire conducting electricity.  The power/s/ you are working with have already shaped and directed the energy.  Don't mess up what they sent you by trying to control it or change it.

&#x200B;

12) Give thanks to whatever force or being you worked with.

&#x200B;

13) Take down the circle in the usual fashion.  It is okay if incense cones/sticks haven't completely burned out.

&#x200B;

14) If you have an urge to do something in particular with the ashes by way of disposing them, do that.  (I usually have an urge to take them outside and blow as forcefully on them as I can, dispursing them into the world.)

&#x200B;

15) Get a bite to eat, and/or do whatever you normally do at the conclusion of a ritual.

&#x200B;

16) If you disabled/covered your smoke detectors, get them working again once the smoke has cleared.",spells

Long short story, a month and something ago, I learnt that my LTR boyfriend cheated on me at the beginning of the year.

I was ready to get over all of it, but a couple of days later he decided it was better for him and I to part ways (heroic right...). 2 weeks later he was with her after swearing he wasn‚Äôt leaving me for her.

So the logical choice for enchanting would be his favorite necklace, which belonged to a close friend that passed away a few years ago. But she was a green witch, and this pendant looks like it was a sigil she might have made herself. I never got to meet her myself, but I asked if he thought enchanting it to help him would be something she would have wanted and he said yes. 

If more info on the possible purpose helps, the origins of the necklace is completely unknown, but if it had a spell my guess is it would be gardening or health based. Her health was always poor, doctors couldn't answer many of them. My boyfriend is the same way, and about once every couple years he suddenly gets hit with a new rare and disorder, but last year it was pretty tame by his standards. (Two episodes of stress induced paralysis. This is what he considers tame.) So if the sigil was health based there would be evidence to back it up, but if it's gardening based he probably overpowers it with his genuinely unnatural ability to kill any plant he touches.

So if this necklace had spells on it already, would there be any harm in another? Would having the second spell align with the original's intentions help? Thanks in advance!",spells

Powerful Ritual for Physical Healing,17,acz7yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/acz7yz/powerful_ritual_for_physical_healing/,6,1546757002.0,"This is an approximation of the spell I used to heal my deathly ill dog. It is an approximation because I performed this spell in the mid-90‚Äôs, I do not have a photographic memory, and I write down magickal theory in my BoS, not individual spells. But I very much believe if I were to use the following spell today under the same circumstances, I would get the same results.

Also, there is no reason this spell cannot be used on people, though the limited awareness of the problem mentioned below tends to be less ideal when people are really sick.

Some don‚Äôt believe such magick is possible, and dismiss my results as coincidence. Here is why I do not believe the 15-year-old dog‚Äôs return to health was a coincidence: we found her lying in her own feces, urine and vomit, too weak to lift her head or wag her tail; she was only barely conscious. We took her to an emergency after-hours vet who ran tests and said the lab results showed that she had five different organ system failures, any one of which could quite possibly kill her. Her death was inevitable, he said, and he recommended putting her out of her misery. My girlfriend couldn‚Äôt handle it, so we took the dog home. Mostly because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle my girlfriend‚Äôs unhinged grief, I resolved to heal the dog if I could.

**I did** ***not*** **perform this ritual just once.** After the first casting the dog was only a little improved. I resolved to repeat the spell nightly until the dog was fully healthy or had died. After the second casting the dog was fully healthy, even her arthritis (which hadn‚Äôt even been on my mind) was gone. She was literally better off after the second ritual than she had been in years. She lived another 1¬Ω years.

I believe that reality is created by our collective net belief in reality, and magick is simply a way to apply belief to change reality. When I decided to perform this ritual there were only three people who knew of the dog‚Äôs immanent death: my girlfriend, myself and the vet. I believe the first ritual had little impact on the dog because most of the energy raised ended up having to counteract the vet‚Äôs belief that the dog‚Äôs death was inevitable. I suspect that if more people had known about the dog‚Äôs immanent death, I would‚Äôve had to perform the ritual several more times. Likewise, if I‚Äôd told non-believers in magick that I was going to use magick to heal the dog, I think it would‚Äôve made the work much more challenging, perhaps impossible.

This spell was based on the concept of divine archetypes: the notion that there are not several gods of death but only one Death entity who wears different faces in different cultural pantheons, and the same for Love, etc. (My belief has since evolved, though I still think this a valid approach to magick and to the divine.) If you want to replace the archetypes below with specific deities, for example replacing ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù with ‚ÄúAnubis‚Äù, that won‚Äôt take anything away from the ritual. Similarly, if after replacing an archetype with a specific deity you want to replace that archetype‚Äôs artifacts with artifacts specific to that deity, for example if after replacing ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù with ‚ÄúAnubis‚Äù you decide to replace the frankincense and myrrh incense recommended for Death with incense associated with Anubis, that should likewise be fine.

**Finally, there are a couple relics mentioned below.** In my practice a ‚Äúrelic‚Äù has a very specific meaning: it is an item which has been enchanted to specifically draw down more power from a given archetype or deity during ritual. If you choose to perform the following ritual without relics, it will probably be a little weaker. That may be okay, if you plan on performing the ritual multiple times as I did or don't need all the power. Use your discretion. [Here are details for how to create a relic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/adytof/relic_creation/)

**Archetypes Evoked (and Why) (in relative order of importance):**

\- Death (When we die is inextricably tied to our health; it is axiomatic that any entity with power over life and death must have power over health. Most of my spells for health that utilized divine assistance have only utilized the archetypal Death or gods of death, and such spells are generally strong and effective. I only added more deities to this ritual for more power.)

\- Love (I supplicated this entity for assistance mainly on the basis that the whole ritual was motivated primarily by my love for my suffering girlfriend, and somewhat also for my love for the dog. If you‚Äôre doing this spell for yourself, you might switch out Love for one of the bottom four entities, or perhaps replace her entirely with another.)

\- Magick (Can strengthen any ritual or working.)

\- Trickster (Always helpful when trying to pull off the seemingly impossible.)

\- Energy (Can strengthen any ritual or working that needs raw power.)

\- Peace (The basis for including Peace was the goal of bringing myself, my girlfriend and the dog peace from suffering.)

\- Fate (Fate is implicated in matters of life and death.)

\- Strategy (To help organize the others‚Äô energies for maximum impact.)

**Items Used (and Why):**

(All photos mentioned below were simply printed from the internet and were around 3‚Äù x 5‚Äù or 4‚Äù x 6‚Äù) (i.e. around 9 cm x 14 cm)

(You don‚Äôt *need* any of the following. But the less you have, the less power your ritual will have. The single most important element was the blood, followed by the relics, followed by the semen‚Ä¶.)

\- 6 sticks of frankincense and myrrh incense (Draws down more power from Death.)

\- A relic for Death (a black-bladed belt knife) (Draws down much more power from Death.)

\- 6 sticks of rose, patchouli, palmarosa or cedarwood incense (Draws down more power from Love.)

\- A relic for Love (two interlocking gold rings) (I custom-ordered them at a ren-faire jeweler) (Draws down much more power from Love.)

\- A small heart-shaped pendant (Draws down more power from Love.)

\- A small bottle of wine. (Draws down more power from Love.)

\- 6 sticks of ‚ÄúIsis‚Äù or cinnamon incense (Draws down more power from Magick.)

\- A photo of a toad, penguin or king cobra (Draws down a little more power from Magick.)

\- A small flask of the cheapest hard liquor I could find (Cheap liquor draws down more power from Trickster.)

\- 5 cheap cigarettes (preferably stale) (Draws down more power from Trickster.)

\- 4 sticks of ‚ÄúWind‚Äù or pine incense (Draws down more power from Energy.)

\- A photo of a mule, horse, ox or Pegasus (Draws down a little more power from Energy.)

\- 4 sticks of vanilla, palmarosa, cedarleaf, or cinnamon incense (Draws down more power from Peace)

\- A photo of an eagle, giraffe or swan (Draws down a little more power from Peace.)

\- 4 sticks of ‚ÄúOcean‚Äù, Lily, or ‚ÄúWater‚Äù incense (Draws down more power from Fate.)

\- A photo of a mosquito, shrew or mermaid (Draws down a little more power from Fate.)

\- 4 sticks of ‚ÄúEgyptian Goddess‚Äù, cedar or amber incense (Draws down more power from Strategy.)

\- A photo of an ant or gorilla (Draws down a little more power from Strategy.)

\- Many drops of my blood (Draws down a LOT more power from Death, and more power from Love‚Äîwhen shed for others, and Magick)

\- My semen (I don‚Äôt write the rules) (Draws down more power from Death, Love, Magick, and Peace.)

\- A box of wooden matches (preferred) or a lighter.

\- A diabetic sharp or sterilized pin to draw blood.

\- Nine pieces of paper. Copy paper is fine. Specialty paper is better.

\- Something to write with.

\- Something fireproof you can burn paper on.

\- Whatever you use to cast circles (e.g. physical representatives of the elements).

\- Whatever common tools you use for ritual (e.g. athame or wand, sage to cleanse yourself, etc.).

\- A glass of water (if needed for fire safety, for example if it‚Äôs autumn and there are a lot of dried leaves).

\- A clipboard or something else hard and portable to write upon.

\- One stick of patchouli. (It helps blend disparate energies.)

Intangible additions:

\- Sappy, romantic language (Draws down more power from Love.)

\- Weird and/or rebellious language (Draws down more power from Trickster.)

Other:

Add whatever stones, herbs, etc. you want. This ritual is about leveraging everything you can into a major working. I was too poor to buy a lot of herbs and stones when I did this ritual. I recommend avoiding using candles outside unless you‚Äôve figured out how to keep the wind from blowing them out.

You can do the three pre-rituals in any order you choose.

**THE PRE-RITUAL, PART I**

There are 32 sticks of incense/cigarettes to charge up. This is too much work for most of us to do along with the main ritual all at one sitting; we don‚Äôt want to be too fatigued by the time the ritual culminates to manage all the energy we‚Äôre raising. I recommend doing the following at least a few hours prior to the main ritual, and making sure you eat and hydrate between workings.

\- 1) Disconnect any smoke detectors. If you cannot, put a plastic bag over them and seal them in place with a rubber band to eliminate airflow into the smoke detector.

\- 2) Do whatever preparations you normally do prior to ritual.

\- 3) Do the following steps eight times, once for each deity‚Äôs incense/cigarettes. Do them in the order above (i.e. starting with Death, ending with Strategy):

\- a) Set one stick of incense aside. Place the remaining 5 or 3 sticks in front of you.

\- b) With intent, slowly and very legibly, write something along the following (making appropriate changes each time):

>Death,  
>  
>An it be by my will and yours, charge these 5 sticks of frankincense and myrrh so that when they are burned, they will draw down your power into the healing spell for \[name of subject being healed\] that I will be performing later.  
>  
>So mote it be!

\- c) When you are done writing, fill the paper with as much energy/intent as you are capable of putting into it. Remember, the intent of this paper isn‚Äôt to heal, it‚Äôs to enchant the incense to draw down this deity‚Äôs power into your future working.

\- d) Read the paper outloud (preferably) or loudly in your head. You are announcing to the cosmos and anyone with the ability to hear you that which is.

\- e) Light the one incense stick you set aside. Do NOT blow it out so that it smokes, leave it aflame. When about half the stick is on fire, use it to set the paper on fire. Make sure the entire paper burns. The energy you put into the paper will draw down the deity‚Äôs power, charging the incense into stronger ritual objects than you could create yourself. (For the cigarettes, just use a match or lighter, not a flaming cigarette).

\- 4) Reconnect or uncover the smoke detectors.

\- 5) Get something to eat; you‚Äôve done a lot of magick and need to replenish the batteries.

**THE PRE-RITUAL, PART II**

Using a diabetic sharp or sterilized needle, prick your finger. It is easier to draw blood from a fingertip if you are near the side of the finger, away from the thicker skin and/or calluses on the pad of the finger. Squeeze around the puncture to force out a drop of blood. Smear the blood onto the last piece of paper, leaving a streak. Squeeze again, and paint a little more of the paper. When blood no longer easily flows from that puncture, repeat on another finger. Continue doing this until one side of the paper is more or less completely red with smeared blood.

If you want to draw even more power into your ritual, you can put more blood on the incense sticks for Death, Love and Magick.

Let the blood on the paper dry.

Alternate: I am told both by spirits and female practitioners that menstrual blood is even more powerful than regular blood. Do with this piece of information as you will.

**THE PRE-RITUAL, PART III**

Acquire semen. Smear it on the same side of the paper that the blood is on. Let it dry. (If you don‚Äôt have access, move forward without it. The ritual will still be effective without it, just not quite as powerful.)

**THE MAIN RITUAL**

(If your tradition associates death, love, etc. with particular cardinal directions that conflict with those laid out here, rearrange to match your tradition.)

\- 1) At a time when you will not be disturbed, go to a cemetery or graveyard. (It‚Äôs Death‚Äôs domain, a place where it‚Äôs easier to draw down Death‚Äôs power. I usually go a few hours after nightfall.)

\- 2) Do whatever preparations you normally do before ritual (smudging, etc.)

\- 3) Cast a larger-than-normal circle using your usual process. (If you don‚Äôt know how, Google it and pick a method you like.)

\- 4) (Optional) If your circle utilizes entities, explicitly ask each to not only safeguard your circle, ask them to strengthen your entire working.

\- 5) Cast an inner circle several inches / centimeters from your outer circle, as follows:

\- a) Facing the direction of death (west, if your culture doesn‚Äôt have a different one), place the five incense sticks for Death. You can push them into the earth if it‚Äôs soft, or put them in a small cup or lump of clay, etc. Please Death‚Äôs relic in front of the incense.

\- b) Moving clockwise, go one-eighth of the circle (so if starting from west, move to northwest). Place the three incense you have for Strategy into the ground. Place the photo for strategy in front of the incense. Place a small rock or other paperweight onto the page.

\- c) Move another eighth. Place the incense for Love. Place the other items for Love in front of the incense.

\- d) Move another eighth. Place the incense for Fate. Place the photo for Fate in front of the incense.

\- e) Move another eighth. Place the incense for Magick. Place the photo for Magick in front of the incense.

\- f) Move another eighth. Place the incense for Peace. Place the photo for Peace in front of the incense.

\- g) Move another eighth. Place the cigarettes for Trickster. Place the other items for Trickster in front of the cigarettes.

\- h) Move another eighth. Place the incense for Energy. Place the photo for Energy in front of the incense.

\- i) Starting with Death and moving clockwise, light each incense/cigarette in turn. Say the name of each entity as you light their incense. Once you are done, know that you have created a sacred space for the eight named deities; you are in their temple.

\- 6) Take several moments to feel the divine energy surrounding you and flowing through you. Then thank each entity in turn, giving them heartfelt thanks for the assistance they‚Äôre about to perform.

\- 7) Pour a libation of wine into the earth in front of Love‚Äôs artifacts. Pour a libation of hard alcohol into the earth in front of Trickster‚Äôs artifacts.

\- 8) Write something along the lines of the following upon the white side of the treated paper:

>Death, Master of Dying and Healing, bless \[Name\] with your powerful healing energies. Make him/her whole, healthy, cured of \[whatever‚Äôs wrong, if known\]. So mote it be.  
>  
>Love, Mistress of the Heart and Emotion,  
>  
>I pray you‚Äôll take a notion  
>  
>To cure the wretched sorrow  
>  
>And bring joy for tomorrow  
>  
>Of she whom I do love,  
>  
>Lift her heart like a dove,  
>  
>And cure \[Name‚Äôs\] ailments today,  
>  
>So mote it be, I pray.  
>  
>Magick, Lady of Sorcery and Mystery, strengthen this working with your might! By your will and august power, may \[Name\] be healed of \[what‚Äôs wrong\]. So mote it be!  
>  
>Trickster, oh reBelLious spiriT. In yOUr Name i. say‚ÄîFUCK the \[whatever‚Äôs wrong\] witch plAgUEs \[name\]. I, say reJekt the kolD inerTIA\* of inevitable deKLINe + ScREW any1 sais IT canot b. It be, So! mote  
>  
>Energy, bless this working with an abundance of your power! Increase, increase, increase the healing which \[Name\] receives from this working. An it be safe for all, So mote it be!  
>  
>Peace, may your blessings be felt by all who love \[Name\] through their healing. Bless this working with your favor. So mote it be.  
>  
>Fate, Mistress of What Was, Is Now, and Will Be: untangle the web which has snared \[Name\] with \[Injury\]. May we all be free of this suffering. So mote it be!  
>  
>Strategy, Bless this working, letting each work their magick in the most effective way to maximize the healing \[Name\] receives. So mote it be!

\- 9) Fill the paper with your intent and energy, but be sure to pull in large amount of the divine energy flowing around you and through you.

\- 10) Read the paper outloud (preferably) or loudly in your head. You are announcing to the cosmos and anyone with the ability to hear you that which is.

\- 11) Feel the energy of the deities around you. Pull them into you and through you and project them outward while chanting something along the lines of ‚ÄúBy Death‚Äôs will, may \[Name\] be healed.‚Äù Then on the next chant change out ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù with ‚ÄúLove‚Äù. Then ‚ÄúMagick‚Äù. Then ‚ÄúTrickster‚Äù. Cycle through all eight deities. On the ninth, chant ‚ÄúBy my will, may \[Name\] be healed‚Äù. Continue to pull in the surrounding energy and project it out while chanting for a fair amount of time, but stop before (or right when you notice) fatigue sets in. (If you fear discovery, you can chant silently, projecting the energy outward mentally.)

\- 12) Light the patchouli incense stick, but do not blow it out. When it‚Äôs about half-burned, use it to light the paper on fire. Make sure the paper burns completely.

\- 13) When the last of the embers have faded, forcefully blow a large, hard puff of air onto the ashes, dispersing them and further spreading your will and the will of the gods out into the cosmos. (Make sure no ash swirls into your eyes when you do this.)

\- 14) Give verbal thanks once again to each deity that has helped you.

\- 15) Light each incense/cigarette in the inner circle on fire, disbursing any remaining energy in each. Start to the left of Death‚Äôs direction and work counter-clockwise, deconstructing the inner circle.

\- 16) If your outer circle has sentient beings, verbally thank each for their help and assistance.

\- 17) Take down your outer circle in your normal fashion.

\- 18) Clean up and get a bite to eat.",spells

An Alternative to Cursing?,13,i2nw3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i2nw3m/an_alternative_to_cursing/,13,1596446298.0,"I found a curse that would bring the actions of someone back onto them threefold when they have hurt you, and I like the idea of helping someone to realize that they have caused so much pain to someone else, but I don't want to harm them.

I know that karma dictates that they will get what's coming to them, but is there something that could open their eyes, because in this specific instance, they refuse to acknowledge that what they did was completely wrong, cost me a lot of money and stress, and almost caused all of us to be homeless. 

(Long story short, they lied about getting jobs to pay rent and then waited the day rent was due to tell me and my other roommate, as we were going to talk to our landlords about the fact that the house all of us were living in was uninhabitable. They then blamed us, their parents, the landlords, the world being unfair, when they ultimately got evicted and me and my other roommate got out due to the uninhabitability. Yes that's the short of it, and doesn't include all of the emotional abuse and gaslighting they put me and my other roommate through.)

It just feels as if they will never know the full extent of the pain they caused when they refuse to even acknowledge that they dug their own graves and threw themselves in, and then wondered why they were in the hole and blamed it on everyone around them. I have tried to explain it to them, but they refuse to acknowledge it or own any of their part in it.

I dont want to curse them, so much as help open their eyes to the vast amount of hurt they have caused. Does anyone know a spell for this?

Non-consentual manipulation magick: the casting witch has no ill intentions to bring harm, chaos, or destruction to the target; the motive is selfish in nature. The target's identifying details were written on tissue paper, folded, sealed with casting witch's blood, pierced by a needle and unintentionally dropped just prior to entering the candle flame. In an effort to improvise, the needle was secured deeper into the hard wax, and a wooden tool was used to ignite the paper. The flames here initially high and steady. Shortly after, it became shorter and danced, but had two peaks, one on each end with a divot in the middle, showing slight resemblance of a heart. 20 hours later, the paper is still aflame, the candle wick has been drown in wax. The flame is short, small, blue/white, and very steady. The source of the flame doesn't appear to exist. Surely there must be a significant interpretation to this?

Ritual of Self-Actualisation,13,fmai81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fmai81/ritual_of_selfactualisation/,2,1584799703.0,"RITUAL OF SEIZING THE MORN/RITUAL OF SELF-ACTUALISATION

This is a Ritual I have created and use daily, the Ritual took a little bit of structural inspiration from the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, however it must be made clear; 

	THIS IS NOT A BANISHING RITUAL. THIS IS NOT AN ADAPTATION OF THE LBRP, SIMILAR ONLY IN STRUCTURE. 

This Ritual is designed for daily use, its purpose is to 'Actualise' the self for the day, to realise and understand that you are part of nature, that you are of the Earth, and have a lot of potential. It is a ritual to be done daily, upon waking and bathing, it can be used as a confidence booster, a motivator, an invocation of energy, and awaking your own energy, power raising, and as intended; for Self Actualisation (realising the power you possess). A seizing the day ritual if you will. 

	Things needed:

	Something to represent the four elements, for e.g:

	1 bowl of water (Water - West) 

	1 stick of incense (Air - North) 

	1 bowl of salt or stones (Earth - East) 

	1 lit candle or dagger (South - Fire)

Now set up the elemental symbols on the floor in their respected positions. I am using a statue of a raven to represent the Air, and a plant to represent the Earth. Position them so that you are in between them, with enough space to move around.
Bathe and be present in clean clothes, or naked. Light the candle. 

Power Raising/Self-Actualization

Enter the space you have made with the symbols of the elements and face the East, in the direction of Earth. 

Touch your forhead with the index finger of your right hand and take a moment to calm the mind. Visualise stardust, the dust and rocks and atoms in space that formed the planets, and the stars, imagine this multicoloured crystal energy; this divine stardust forming everything; space, planets, galaxies, etc. Visualise this power forming the self, swirling around you (you as a person) and realise what you know to be true; that you are of the Earth. 

When the visualisation is strong, vibrate the words ""Alive"" and ""Awake"", do this in one breath for each word; like this:
	
	""AAAALLLLL - IIIIIIIIIVVVVE""

Next breath:

	""AAAAAAA - WAAAAAAAKE""

Now point your right hand to the sky and your left to the ground (similar to the symbolism of The Magician Tarot Card, of the Arthur Edward Waite Deck) and form that pose. Now visualise even more strongly this stardust, now it is coming from the ground into the left hand, and from the sky into the right hand, feel it. You are a catalyst of Magick, magick is you. Know again that you are of the Earth, a part of this world, a part of nature. 
Now vibrate these words while visualising: 

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""

Say it like this; 
	first breath equals 

	""IIIIIIIII - AMMMMM - OOONNNNNE"" 

Second breath equals

	""ONNNNNNNE - ISSSSS - MEEEEE"" 

Third beath equals

	""AALLLLLLL - ISSSSSSSSSS - ONNNNNNNNE"" 

What is being done here is what I like to call Self-Actualisation, also the visualisation is being vocalised; that the self (you) are the same divinity of the world around us, 'you' are one and one is all. Continue the visualisation of the Divine power moving through you, until you see it and feel it strongly. Know you are a part of nature, and of power.

Now, still facing East. Slash through the air like a knife of strong winds. And vibrate:

	""Mighty as wind"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""MIIIIIGHT - YYYYY - ASSSSS - WIIIIIIIIND"" 

Then say:

	""As strong as the hardest winds, but I am a gentle breeze"" 

Draw a pentegram with your hand in the air, within the pentegram, visualise the space and stars, and multicoloured crystal energies, the same space and stars from earlier. 
	
Now put the hands together in a prayer like position and visualise absorbing bright yellow energy coming from the depth of space. When satisfied with strong visualisation, Bow, then turn to the South. 

Facing South. Punch forward directly, like a directed flame. Vibrate:

	""Fierce as Flames"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""FIIIII - ERRRRRRRCE - ASSSSS - FLAAAAAAMMES"" 

Then say:

	""Fierce as a directed fire and warm as the brightest flame""

Repeat the pentegram, imagine the space, the Divine energies, space and stars flowing within and around, 
Hands as before, prayer like and visualise. This time the energy you are absorbing is bright red energies from inside the pentegram, from the vastness of space. Allow this red energy to fill you up. Bow, then turn towards the West. 

Facing West. Lift arm up, like throwing heavy waves. And vibrate:

	""Soul of the Waves"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""SOOOULLLLL - OFFFF - THEEEEE - WAVVVVVES"" 

Then say:

	""Mighty as the grandest wave and calming as the sea"" 

Again, repeat the pentegram and visualisation of deep space within it, the Magickal multi coloured crystal like energy. 
Now hands in prayer position again, visualise absorbing beautiful blue energies from the depth of space, from within the pentegram, allow this blue to fill you. Bow, and turn towards the North. 

Facing North. Tense the arm to symbolise the strength of the earth. Vibrate:

	""Steadfast as Earth"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""STEEEAADD - FAAAST - ASSSSS - EARRRRRTH"" 

Then say:

	""Steadfast as Earth and the body of all life"" 

Again repeat the pentegram and visualisation of the Divine energy and space, hands in prayer position, visualise absorbing wondrous green energies this time, from the depth of space. 

Turn back towards the East. Visualise all the different colours and energies flowing all around you and through you. 
Again, repeat The Magician Pose and absorb all these energies, allow them to crash around you, into you, you are brimming with the power of the elements, now just like before, repeat these earlier vibrations:

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""
	(While in The Magician Pose) 

Then touch forhead and vibrate:

	""Alive"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

	""Awake"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

Stomp right foot or ring a bell to conclude. 

You are now self actualized and ready for all, aware of the power you possess. 

	NOTE: ALL PENTAGRAMS DRAWN SHOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR, BE IT A BEAUTIFUL BLUE OR BLINDING WHITE. THEY ARE INVOKING PENTAGRAMS.

Blood Magick for Healing Spell?,12,iscgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iscgpr/blood_magick_for_healing_spell/,5,1600080405.0,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to make this as brief as I can. My partner was recently diagnosed with having UVH (Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction). It's a bit rare compared to BVH, and we're pretty young. To break it down, UVH is when one ear stops communicating proper signals to the brain, which then compromises one's sense of balance. It basically feels like you're drunk all the time, but without any of the good feelings from it. At least that's how my partner puts it. It might be permanent, but it might go away on its own within several weeks. Currently what we're able to do is some physical therapy exercises to retrain the nerve to properly communicate with his brain.

However, I've been thinking about working a spell for my partner that may help the healing process, even if I can reduce the dizziness for him too. And that's why I wanted to know if its a good idea to use blood magick (a prick of the finger really) to amplify the healing spell. I will more than likely get a strand or two of his hair as well to make the spell as specific for him as I possibly can. 

I've never included blood magick in my spells before, because I know it's very powerful. I don't include certain things in my energy work unless I know I've done my research for it.

Thoughts? Have any of you ever done blood magick to help amplify a healing spell? How'd it turn out? I'd really appreciate some stories. Thanks in advance!",spells

&#x200B;

OK YOU ASKED FOR IT: TL:DR- long, detailed, and totally customizable ritual, with a list of further correspondences and suggestions at the very end.

Find a writing utensil that is red, pink or purple. Cut a piece of paper into a heart and with focus, write down your EXACT INTENT. For instance (if this is accurate, and if not, tweak it to make it so) write that you are increasing your own sexual attractiveness, attracting those people to you who would desire you and you would find desirable in return, increasing your glamour and confidence. Create a chant or small poem that expresses this intent. then make a border around the entire thing using the words for a protection spell. [quick and dirty example ](https://imgur.com/gallery/TRmOKXU)You want the protective border to specifically state that you wish to draw no one near you who might wish or cause you harm, that your strength and safety be increased along with your attractiveness, and that no one‚Äôs will be overcome, including your own. Put all of this in your own words, but make sure that border protects you from harm and Ill will.

Charge your cinnamon, your crystal, some sugar, and a pinch of salt in your hand with your intent (passion and lust drawing/increasing). Anoint the base your candle (for example,if it was an 8 inch taper candle, you‚Äôre putting it on the bottom inch of the candle, and when applying it, use upward strokes)with a small bit of oil- canola, olive, etc... or with a very small amount of some sort of fat,like coconut oil or cocoa butter or even butter. You‚Äôll then dip the oiled bottom if the candle in your spice mixture, shaking off the excess. [https://imgur.com/gallery/GviFJDy](https://imgur.com/gallery/GviFJDy) Keep the excess. Place your heart shaped paper under the candle and light it. Now:

Draw yourself a bath. important- if you don‚Äôt have access to a full bath, you‚Äôll first wash your feet, and then draw fresh water to do a foot soak using a bucket, bowl, pot or even the bathroom sink. Place your rose quartz in the water. If you do this foot soak method instead, simply dip your fingers into the water and anoint every part of your body with the water, either once or as often as you wanna. Continue to periodically state your intent by repeating the chant/poem, etc. stay in water for at least ten minutes, and when you are done, do not rinse. Take enough of a red, purple, pink or white piece of cloth to make a small satchel, and place your paper, excess spices, an extra pinch of salt and sugar, and the rose quartz( if its small enough) onto it and draw the corners up to make a little bag. Use a ribbon- either red, pink, purple, gold or silver, to close and secure the bag. Knot the ribbon six times, chanting your intent for each knot you make. Pick your favorite scent, whichever makes you feel sexiest, and apply it to the outside of the bag. Tuck the bag into your cleavage, or attach it to a ribbon, chord, or chain and wear it either around your neck or around your waist. Keep it hidden the best you can, at least. If someone sees it and asks you about it, reply, SPECIFICALLY- that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlove pendant‚Äù given to you by a loved one. If they continue to ask about it, explain that it‚Äôs an intimate gift that is very dear to you and not meant to be explained.

If you would like to call upon a diety for their help in this endeavor, I might suggest:

SHAKTI: divine feminine force and source of creation, concentrate on increasing and channeling the Dynamic, creative force within you.

BAST: (my favorite for these sorts of spells) when calling on her, involve as much fragrance as possible, make sure the bag is anointed with a beautiful perfume and also perfume the water you bathe /soak in. When you make your heart paper, include within it a drawing of a cat (if you struggle to create a beautiful feline form, look up stock images on the internet for silhouettes of cats, it should really help. [feline forms](https://images.app.goo.gl/GHj8jH4eks6cKa1N8) include a cat charm if you wish and one is available. Once the bag is tied up, use your index finger to draw the name BAST on the outside of it, visualizing a crimson light spelling out the word, then trace over it again visualizing purple, and one last time while visualizing a lush, sparkling golden light that eventually spreads out to encompass the entire bag. (Don‚Äôt forget to let the last act in the ritual being a thank you to any deity you called upon)

APHRODITE: add a more generous amount of salt to the bath or soak, to signify sea water. If you have any pearls, add them to the bag. If you have any shells, visualize retrieving them from the sand where waves, sparkling with gold light, have just washed up, hold them in your hand while whispering your intent to Aphrodite herself, before placing in the bag.

INNANA/ISHTAR: [star of Inanna/Ishtar](https://images.app.goo.gl/K8mJgrg3Z53gusmEA) Look, this one is bursting with Passion and Fury. The simplest and most primary evocative of her symbols is probably the eight pointed star. Look it up to see is various interpretations. I don‚Äôt know how experienced you are, but just know she is POWERFUL and although this is true for ALL the deities, in particular she is not to be called without a healthy dose of respect and caution. Adopt her lion/lioness patron and allow her lust and passionate light flow from you- a glowing wine-red crimson and lapis lazuli blue light, (a corresponding stone of hers) illuminating your feet, the insides of your thighs, your crotch, your navel, your breasts or chest, throat, lips/tongue, and crown, and with your third eye, see those point of light spreading outwards, towards each other, until ever inch of your skin is covered with that glow, when the light intensifies and then streams outward in three sparkling streams-from your crotch, your solar plexus, and your chest, to bathe your bundle of magic. Allow the light to be absorbed into it, the bag glowing hot like lava, then let the light fade until only an eight pointed star and the name INANNA are left on the outside, written in a barely-seen, crackling light. Kiss the bag in that spot, eight times, then kiss your own finger once and touch it to the knots of the ribbon. Whisper thanks to INNANA.

There are so many others to call upon if you wish, and if you‚Äôre looking for MALE deities to work with instead, let me know and I‚Äôll give suggestions.

LASTLY: if you‚Äôre comfortable with, um.... well, sexy magick: pleasure yourself while bathing or soaking your feet... right before release, get a picture in your head that symbolizes your intent (it‚Äôs helpful to figure this out beforehand because trying to come up with it at this point of time might be a little difficult üòÇ, and you won‚Äôt be able to focus on it), and when you come, let that energy go streaming into the water. DONT DRAIN THE WATER YET... anoint the bag and your body with that water at the end of the ritual.

Other correspondences that you could add to strengthen the spell:

\*Performing on a Friday, \*Performing during a waxing or full moon \*The moon or mars in Venus, avoiding negative aspects, with trines to your personal mars and Venus being especially helpful \*HELPFUL BOTANICALS :red roses, ylang ylang, amber, orange blossom/neroli, patchouli, jasmine, marjoram, GINGER, black pepper, cinnamon, hibiscus, basil. My favorite is VANILLA , especially a whole pod of fresh vanilla bean. LEMON VERBENA is not only good for heart or base chakra based magick but also gives a boost to the efficacy of the other herbs. Use LAVENDER to balance any particularly spicy additions like pepper and ginger. Note: musk and ambergris oils are classic but rare and not sustainably, or even legally, acquired)

\*incorporating JEWELRY, anointing it with spice mixture, any fragrance or oils you may use and then soaking water, and wearing it.

\*carnelian, red jasper, garnets, rubies, smoky quartz, and of course: rose quartz üòò.

\*anointing red, purple, black, white and/or metallic underwear

\*using primal, drum-heavy music during ritual/bath.

\*Using henna to draw a symbol of lust you‚Äôve chosen, or small phrase of intent, symbol of patron deity called upon in your ritual, or even the words ‚Äúlust‚Äù, ‚Äúdesire‚Äù or simple drawings of hearts or sexual symbols on a part of your body that is completely hidden from view until you‚Äôre getting naked, basically, lolll.",spells

Relic Creation,11,adytof,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/adytof/relic_creation/,0,1547009684.0,"In my practice, the term ""relic"" has a very specific meaning: it's an item than has been enchanted to draw down more power from a deity or archetype whenever said relic is included during ritual or spellwork. This of course makes the resulting spell more powerful, which is the point of using relics.

A relic that is used regularly or semi-regularly does not need to be recharged; the enchantment is refreshed every time it's used. If several months pass, repeat the ritual below to recharge it.

A relic should be a solid item, preferably hard (metal items are ideal) and ideally the item should be appropriate to the deity or archetype: scales for a being with power over justice, interlocked gold rings for a being with power over love, etc. 

A relic, once enchanted, should not be used for any other purpose.

Humans don't enchant relics. We have to do a ritual that invites the deity or archetype to enchant the item for us. Here's one way. Feel to add herbs, stones, other symbolism, blood, etc. appropriately.

1) Cast your circle in your usual fashion.

2) Cast an inner circle using four charged sticks of incense or four charged candles, appropriately scented for the entity being petitioned.  You are creating a temporary inner temple sacred to the entity being petitioned.

3) While within the inner circle, neatly and with clear intent, write on a normal piece of copy paper or nicer paper, something along the following:

>[Name of Entity, With Titles & Honorifics If Any], 

>An it be by your will, bless and enchant this [item] with your power, such that it is a relic which will please you and draw down more of your power whenever used in spellwork. 

>So mote it be!

4) Charge the paper with energy/intent. Draw from the sacred energy all around you; it will make the results stronger.  The more effort overall you put into this, the stronger the relic will be, making each subsequent spell which uses said relic that much more powerful.

5) Read the paper out loud, in a firm voice.

6) Place the relic in front of you.  Light an incense stick pleasing to the entity on fire. Do not blow it out, however. Once half the stick is on fire, use it to set the paper on fire. Make sure the entire paper burns.

7) Lift up the charged relic above your head. Give thanks to the entity for blessing it. 

8) Take down both circles. 

9) Put the relic on your altar or somewhere else safe. Grab a bite to eat.",spells
How fast do love spells work,9,j60769,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j60769/how_fast_do_love_spells_work/,7,1601994603.0,"Hello please don‚Äôt judge me üôÇ
I  did a love spell on my ex boyfriend we were together for nearly 7 years, broke up 6 months and haven‚Äôt spoken in over 3 months. The next day he called me and we talked for hours he admitted to missing me, still loving me, etc but also admitted he was dating someone but it‚Äôs only been a few weeks and it‚Äôs not official, the next day we also spoke. Anyway him calling me the very next day after casting the spell confused me because again we haven‚Äôt spoken in over 3 months so it made me wonder was the love spell working or was this just a coincidence. Anyway a few days went by and we text but didn‚Äôt speak and I decided to write him a long message basically telling him how I feel and asked him if he would consider giving us another chance, I told him if he says No then I‚Äôm willing to accept it which I really am. Which brings my question out of desperation I did the love spell, if the love spell is working then how can I break it?

Bad Roommate Situation,11,eq52co,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/eq52co/bad_roommate_situation/,4,1579317935.0,"I‚Äôm new here, so it‚Äôs unfortunate that I‚Äôll have an unpleasant introduction, but something needs to be done. I‚Äôm expecting y‚Äôall to give me an answer other than a spell, but I think this is the best community to start with asking for advice. If another place is more fit, please let me know. 

I unexpectedly got a new roommate and it all happened very quickly. She is extremely rude and judgmental of me, my guests, my food, etc. On the other hand, though, she absolutely will not leave me alone. As soon as I walk through the door, her bedroom door flies open and she comes out to the common area to meet me with a constant stream of judgmental speech. When I can get a word in, it sends her on a new tangent of how awful the topic is. I tried reaching out to an old friend who used to work with my new roommate to see how to deal with her. The friend told me she never figured it out, the girl has always been outrageous, and wished me luck. 

She‚Äôs also wildly offended that my friends aren‚Äôt immediately hers too. These girls have been my best friends since last year. They treat me like a roommate and I‚Äôm there all day everyday, and my roommate doesn‚Äôt see why she can‚Äôt just walk in to their apartment. I took care to introduce her to them, but she didn‚Äôt care to hear their names and they‚Äôve independently decided that they aren‚Äôt interested in befriending her either. This all lead to days of my roommate going off on me over text about how ‚Äúhilarious and fun she is‚Äù and ‚Äúno one else has ever thought she was rude‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are all supposed to be friends‚Äù. 

A lot of it seems like a defense mechanism, as if she‚Äôs beating me down to feel better about herself. She has no friends here, is financially supported by her parents, and shared with me that she does extremely poorly as far as school (we‚Äôre in college). On that note, she really likes to tell me how shitty I am for wanting to party once in a while. She also stays with her parents 2-3 nights a week. I just don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be happy here for those reasons, so maybe she‚Äôll leave on her own accord. 

My first instinct was to get her out. I tried hotfoot powder, and a few days later she started looking to move to a new floor plan this fall. I‚Äôll be here until June and need something faster. It seems like this community discourages banishing and things of the like, but what are my other options? Should I focus on strengthening myself to stand up to her in the moment? Maybe just something small to speed up the powder? I feel stuck. I don‚Äôt think I want anything bad for her, as it seems like she genuinely believes she‚Äôs kind and considerate. But she‚Äôs killing my energy. Her negativity/ judgement makes me tired and I don‚Äôt know if I can start the  semester like this (I also work two jobs). 

Anything helps. It feels like there are a lot of ways to take this, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.",spells

The Egyptian Opening of the Mouth Ritual,11,bbzvca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/bbzvca/the_egyptian_opening_of_the_mouth_ritual/,1,1555018084.0,"The following is a modified rendition of the ancient spell Egyptians used to infuse the statues of their gods with the *ka* (loosely, soul essence) of that god, thus making it not just a representation of their god but actually making their god physically present--able to look out through the statue's eyes, hear with the statue's ears, etc.  (The same ritual was used to place the *ka* of the dead into their mummies.)

For better or worse, this ritual also basically creates a portal through which the deity may more easily put his/her influence out into the world.  Accepting a god as your patron deity invites their presence into your life in a really significant way; doing this spell to a statue takes that to the next level.

The spell becomes stronger with every offering you make to the god through the statue.

True story:  I was once in a museum displaying Egyptian artifacts; I was more enraptured by the idea that these things came from thousands of years ago than thinking about magick.  My girlfriend asked me to sense a statue of Ra on display.  Thinking I might find a curse or protective energy or something, I reached out, and discovered Ra was still present in that statue, watching me looking at him.  Someone had done the Opening of the Mouth ritual on that statue and it was still going thousands of years later.  Don't use this ritual unless you already know your relationship with the deity is going to extend well into the future.

I've used this ritual on Egyptian and non-Egyptian deities.  It worked on both... but oddly, while it felt natural to pray to Egyptian deities through their awakened statues, I found myself not using my non-Egyptian statue during prayer.  That said, the non-Egyptian god certainly uses his statue to influence events in my life.  Do with that observation what you will.

(The modifications include things like using an athame in lieu of an adze, not requiring you to sacrifice an ox heart or use an ox leg ritually, etc.)

(Some of the spoken English is a little awkward; I have opted to not rewrite it because it better aligns with the original wording this way, and I think that adds a bit more power to the ritual.  If you disagree, feel free to make minor edits.)

\-----------

**MATERIALS NEEDED**

Object to be animated

4 candles, scent and/or color appropriate to the god (if known)

1 incense, scent appropriate to the god (if known)

Athame

Purified or spring water & cup or bowl

Lighter or matches

Feather

Towel (preferably white)

&#x200B;

**THE RITUAL**

(Italicized passages are to be spoken in a firm voice.  The power of the spoken word in Egyptian magick is phenomenal.)

1. Cleanse your ritual space and invoke your power, Egyptian-style:

A. Begin facing west, with athame in hand.

*May Ptah give me voice, remove the wrappings! Remove the wrappings which the lesser gods have placed over my mouth.*

*Come unto me Djewhty, bearer of Heka, full of Heka, remove the wrappings! Remove the wrappings of Suti which fetter my mouth.*

*May Tem turn back those who would restrain me.*

*Give me voice! May my mouth be opened by Shu with that divine instrument of iron with which the gods were given voice.*

*I am Sekhet! I watch over the heaven of the west.*

*I am Sakhu! I watch over the souls of Annu.*

*May the gods and their children hear my voice, and resist those who would silence me.*

&#x200B;

B. Take the ritual dagger and trace a vertical line in the air to the west, in a smooth downward motion.

*Qebhsennuf!*

&#x200B;

C. Turn to the south and trace a vertical line in the air.

*Amset!*

&#x200B;

D. Turn to the east and trace a vertical line in the air.

*Tuamutef!*

&#x200B;

E. Turn to the north, and trace another vertical line from top to bottom.

*Hapi!*

*I am the flame which shines upon the Opener of Eternity!*

&#x200B;

2) Cast a circle using the four candles.  You are creating a space that is sacred to the god, effectively a temporary temple.

&#x200B;

3) Charge the incense with energy to intensify the god's power and awareness.  Light the incense.

&#x200B;

4) Dribble purified or spring water over the statue, cleansing it.  Cup and pour three times.  Be gentle, as with a baby.  Pat the statue dry with the towel.

&#x200B;

5) Fumigate the statue in the incense smoke, knowing that the statue is absorbing power from the incense and will be breathing in the scented smoke before the ritual is done.

&#x200B;

6) Using your athame, ‚Äúpry open‚Äù mouth on the statue, intoning the following:

*Your mouth is opened by Ptah, the bonds that gag your mouth have been loosed.  Isis comes fully equipped with heka.  Your mouth has been parted by Ptah with his metal blade of his with which he parted the mouths of the gods.  Awaken!  May you be as alert as a living one, rejuvenated every day, healthy in millions of occasions of god sleep, while the gods protect you, protection being around you every day.*

&#x200B;

7) Mentally picture a perfect, unblemished ox heart.  Visualize it intently, filling your visualization with energy.  Then see the energy align and self-adjust to match the best, most perfect ox heart ever used for ritual purposes in ancient Egypt, the most suitable offering to a holy deity possible, perfect and optimal in every way.  Offer it to the spirit of the statue.  Let the statue absorb the energy of your ox heart offering.

&#x200B;

8) Mentally picture a foreleg of an unblemished, perfect ox, using the same steps as above.  Pry open the mouth of the statue using the ox leg, and feel the power and vitality within the leg flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

9) Using the pinky finger on whichever hand you write with (your ""power hand""), ‚Äúpry open‚Äù the mouth of the statue.

&#x200B;

10) Pick up the feather and intently visualize it containing perfect soul essence.  Bless the forehead and lips of the statue with the feather and feel the ka of the feather flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

11) Dribble purified or spring water over the statue, cleansing it.  Cup and pour three times.  Be gentle, as with a baby.  Pat the statue dry with the towel.

&#x200B;

12) Fumigate the statue in incense, knowing that the statue is absorbing power and will be breathing in incense before the ritual is done.

&#x200B;

13) Using your pinky finger, pry open the mouth, intoning the following:

*Your mouth is split open by Horus with his little finger of his with which he split open the mouth of his father Osiris.  Awaken!  May you be as alert as a living one, rejuvenated every day, healthy in millions of occasions of god sleep, while the gods protect you, protection being around you every day.*

&#x200B;

14) Dribble purified or spring water over the statue, cleansing it.  Cup and pour three times.  Be gentle, as with a baby.  Pat the statue dry with the towel.

&#x200B;

15) Fumigate the statue in incense, knowing that the statue is absorbing power and will be breathing in incense before the ritual is done.

&#x200B;

16) Using your athame, ‚Äúpry open‚Äù the mouth on the statue, intoning the following (Set being used in his capacity as God of Strength and Metal):

*Your mouth is opened by Set, the bonds that gag your mouth have been loosed.  Isis comes fully equipped with heka.  Your mouth has been parted by Set with his metal blade of his with which he parted the mouths of the gods.  Awaken!  May you be as alert as a living one, rejuvenated every day, healthy in millions of occasions of god sleep, while the gods protect you, protection being around you every day.*

&#x200B;

17) Mentally picture a perfect, unblemished ox heart.  See it glow with perfect light as it unites with the universal ka of all ox heart offerings fit for gods.  Offer it to the spirit of the statue.

&#x200B;

18)	Mentally picture a foreleg of an unblemished, perfect ox.  Pry open the mouth of the statue using the ox leg, and feel the power and vitality within the leg flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

19)	Using the pinky finger, ‚Äúpry open‚Äù the mouth of the statue.

&#x200B;

20)	Pick up the feather and see it containing perfect soul essence.  Bless the forehead and lips of the statue with the feather and feel the ka of the feather flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

21) Dribble purified or spring water over the statue, cleansing it.  Cup and pour three times.  Be gentle, as with a baby.  Pat the statue dry with the towel.

&#x200B;

22) Fumigate the statue in incense, knowing that the statue is absorbing power and will be breathing in the incense before the ritual is done.

&#x200B;

23) Using your athame, ‚Äúpry open‚Äù the mouth on the statue, intoning the following:

*Your mouth is opened by Thoth, the bonds that gag your mouth have been loosed.  Isis comes fully equipped with heka.  Your mouth has been parted by Thoth with his metal blade of his with which he parted the mouths of the gods.  Awaken!  May you be as alert as a living one, rejuvenated every day, healthy in millions of occasions of god sleep, while the gods protect you, protection being around you every day.*

&#x200B;

24) Mentally picture a perfect, unblemished ox heart.  See it glow with perfect light as it unites with the universal ka of all ox heart offerings fit for gods.  Offer it to the spirit of the statue.

&#x200B;

25)	Mentally picture a foreleg of an unblemished, perfect ox.  Pry open the mouth of the statue using the ox leg, and feel the power and vitality within the leg flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

26)	Using the pinky finger, ‚Äúpry open‚Äù the mouth of the statue.

&#x200B;

27)	Pick up the feather and see it containing perfect soul essence.  Bless the forehead and lips of the statue with the feather and feel the ka of the feather flow into the statue.

&#x200B;

28) Invoke the power of the deity:

A. Face west, with athame in hand, your statue in front of you.  Direct your words at the statue:

*May Ptah give you voice, remove the wrappings! Remove the wrappings which the lesser gods have placed over your mouth.*

*Come unto you Djewhty, bearer of Heka, full of Heka, remove the wrappings! Remove the wrappings of Suti which fetter your mouth.*

*May Tem turn back those who would restrain you.*

*Give you voice! May your mouth be opened by Shu with that divine instrument of iron with which the gods were given voice.*

*You are Sekhet! You watch over the heaven of the west.*

*You are Sakhu! You watch over the souls of Annu.*

*May the gods and their children hear your voice, and resist those who would silence you.*

*You are the flame which shines upon the Opener of Eternity!*

&#x200B;

29) Greet the god now inside your statue, and give him or her thanks for being a part of your life.",spells

Hello everyone! 

Like pretty much everyone else in the world, my SO and I have really been struggling through this pandemic. He already has clinical anxiety and depression (which is being treated medically) but the pandemic has really made things even worse. He has made it very clear that he is not unhappy with me or our relationship, but that he is just miserable in general. He hates his job, his boss, and his co-workers,(poorly run company not taking care of their employees during the pandemic) and while home is not something he hates, he is so miserable that the few hours he is at home don't really provide him with relief or the ability to relax, and every company in our area is on a hiring freeze until the pandemic is over. Our relationship has suffered because of this, bc he is almost always on edge, and he has no energy or motivation to engage. He spends most evenings on reddit (not this forum though!) before collapsing in bed, where he doesn't sleep well at all. 

I was thinking about maybe doing a honey jar to sweeten his thoughts of me and his thoughts of home. So that home is a place he doesn't have the weight of everything pressing on him, and that thinking of me/home brings him comfort during his day. 

I thought about including a cord with 7 knots, a rose quartz, some of his hair, some of my hair, and then also the paper with the spell on it. Are there any other ingredients you'd recommend? I'm not really sure what to write on the paper, on the part where I write my intention over and over without lifting the pen. I'm looking for some combination of the following

 ""Our home is a place of love and joy"" 

""Your struggles fall away in our home"" 

""Our home and our relationship brings you comfort and joy"". 

Other spell/magical suggestions are most welcome,
Maybe something I could sprinkle around our doors so that when he crosses the threshold he feels relaxed?

Pretty sure I‚Äôm cursed,10,he1s9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/he1s9j/pretty_sure_im_cursed/,13,1592891943.0,"So, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm cursed but would like others opinions on this. About a year and a half ago terrible things started happening to me and my partner. We have friends into the occult and it seems these bad things happen around then or after seeing them. I got an awful job that caused serious mental harm no matter how hard I tried. My favorite necklace went missing after said friend complimented it. My partner ended up breaking a bone and having a terrible experience at the hospital, my cat died a few weeks after they stayed with us. I got diagnosed with a somewhat rare disease that‚Äôs done awful things to my body. I had a terrible trip on drugs and the first person I felt like I had to call was those same friends vs other friends that are closer to me. After video chatting with them my other favorite necklace went missing after they complimented it again. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd lose it when I‚Äôve barely left the house. I‚Äôve also been having the most terrible time at work and had multiple emotional breakdowns and can‚Äôt seem to do anything right since the bad trip, but that could be due to the pandemic and the terrible systematic racism we have in the world. 

I‚Äôve been having nightmares and most recently I had a walking stick cactus monster in it that was extremely bizarre. In the same dream my brother died and I woke up crying. He has been sick the last few weeks but teeth pain and a pinched nerve in his back, nothing serious. 

Today, out of no where, I felt I might have been cursed and had a weird feeling. I usually don‚Äôt believe in these things but it just kind of clicked in my mind. I feel crazy even typing this out which is why I‚Äôm on an alt account. Any thoughts on if this could be one or not?

Always dabbled in spells solo and am accustomed to utilizing candles, Gemstones, and moon phases in the past.  I‚Äôm totally a baby bruja and am looking to expand my horizons.

I need a serious spell for a serious manipulator in my life:  my horrible MIL.  She has the wool pulled over my husband‚Äôs eyes big time, through flattery and giving him money.  He‚Äôs a good person with a good heart, and I desperately want him to see what she really is.  This is a long story, but I have a rooted instinct that she has stolen from our family.  I want the secret revealed in a way that cannot be denied.  And I want it revealed to HIM.

I recently did what the interwebs told me to do, carving her name on an onion and leaving it in the forest.  It did SOME good at revealing her further to EVERYONE ELSE.  

How to approach this, witches?  Do I do a spell to open his eyes along with another for exposing her?  Help please!",spells

Holy water/blessed moon or sun water + sulfur (easily gotten from match heads) + oak ash. Mix them together while chanting a prayer of protection and warding (3x). Put into a spray bottle. In a bowl, mix blessed salt with eggshell and cumin or turmeric, set aside for later. If u have a feather, light a black candle and go around the effected space making a shooing motion with the feather (or the back of your hand if a feather cannot b found), visualize a black field emerging from the candle in the direction you send the energy until the whole space is surrounded. Now take the bottle and spray around the perimeter of the area. The sulfur works to repel any other harmful spirits with the oak ash will fortify the ward further. After that is done, go along the same area with a white candle and repeat the process as with the black candle, visualize a white cloud of protection and purity all around. Along the doors and window sills as well as inside the fireplace if there is one (pretty much anywhere there's a way the enter the house) place a pinch of the salt/shell mixture to prevent harmful energy from entering your space. This should keep your space heavily fortified for a good while. I'd recommend doing it every quarter tho or as often as u feel u need to.",spells

I need help creating a Binding/Freezing spell for a thief who is planning on coming back to steal again.,7,idjg7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/idjg7x/i_need_help_creating_a_bindingfreezing_spell_for/,3,1597988142.0,"*edit* I am not interested in or able to pay someone to cast this spell for me. I am only looking for advice. 

This morning I woke up to find that my spare car key had been stolen. I don't want to go into details, but I think they are probably planning on coming back to steal my car, bc why else would they steal the keys? I have done all there is to do in the mundane, police are useless, as usual. 

In my head, I'm thinking of creating a three part spell/ritual,
- to make the key uncomfortable for them to touch (my initial thought is make a clay or wooden key and put in a fire, while chanting something like their guilt will burn as hot as the flames every time they touch it.)
- to disable the key (maybe smashing the key after it has been in the fire, while saying something like this will only work for the rightful owner) 
- and finally something to bind them from stealing again. I don't know who this person is, if it is one person or a group of people working together (there were several items stolen from other people in the area), so I don't know if it would be suitable for a spell where I'd normally write someone's name on a piece of paper. I thought about making a genderless clay figurine, and touching it's hands to all the surfaces this person would have had to have touched, and then tying their hands behind their back, while saying something about hands that were not welcome will be bound or something like that, and then freezing the figure (or burning it as well, to symbolise their conscience burning them too bad to steal again) 

Clearly, I need help with the wording of things. I also am drawn to color and candle magic, so whatever color associations you feel would be appropriate here would be helpful.

It‚Äôs hard to explain. They usually manifest exactly how the dream plays out but very rarely they‚Äôre more symbolic and make sense later. I can usually tell which is which but this time I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôm currently sat up in bed because I awoke from a prophetic dream (not sure whether symbolic or actual). In this dream, I was sat on my couch  with my mother, and I knew that someone was coming for me at 7:00pm, someone bad. I was doing normal stuff for a while like I was just okay? With the situation. I kept looking at a photograph of someone. Later on in the dream, I looked towards my phone and it said 7:09pm. I set everything I was holding down and just waited. A few moments later a man in a hoodie came around the corner and his face was initially obscured by a white light. 

Me and a friend have been seeing the same figure in dreams, who is pure white. In hers, he spoke and it sounded demonic to her and she ran. In mine, I was chasing him. I‚Äôm not sure if this is at all connected but I thought the white light was a fairly big coincidence to have. 

When he came around the corner the light slowly died off and I saw his face. I don‚Äôt recognise this man at all, and he was asking me about the person in the photograph, asking me where they were. I was calmly saying that the person was dead, incredibly calmly. Then, the man was crying and he started to hack at my hands, cutting them. I could feel the pain but I was still quite calm, and then I woke up. 

Not sure if real or symbolic but definitely prophetic. I‚Äôm not sure how to explain how I know, it‚Äôs just kind of like a dark sort of holographic overlay. But I know. 

Anyway, the reason this has freaked me out so much is because I and my family were robbed as a child and I woke up during to see five armed men in my living room. I was Christian back then, I‚Äôm not now but I had a dream about it weeks before it happened, and couldn‚Äôt accept that my dreams meant something at that time because of my religion. I didn‚Äôt believe in anything like this. That dream, though quite outlandish with the choices of weapons and what they said, was a ‚Äòreal‚Äô dream. It happened exactly as I dreamt it. Now, I‚Äôm incredibly worried about this one. Can anyone recommend a relatively simple protection spell? I‚Äôm new to spell work but I need the piece of mind.

I only recently discovered how abusive when he was able to leave a couple of years ago and he told me how manipulative and cruel she was, gaslighting, isolating him, humiliating him. But she would have moments of affection towards him, which along with thinking he was always in the wrong and he had nowhere to go meant he stayed for 15 years. He eventually left, but as they have children she has still been able to manipulate him into doing what she wants, has broken up other relationships he has tried to have and has now got him to move back in. She was in another relationship, i think before he even left last time. Every time she broke up she would break him up, but this is the first time she has made him move back in, in the two years they have been separated. The isolation has already started, some of the friends he has made over the last two years have received nasty messages from both hers and his social media accounts when they have tried to get in contact.
For full disclosure I was one of the people she made him leave, very recently, last week. She had already broken us up in the summer but didn't want him to move in, she was trying to get him to rent somewhere close to hers. She told someone at the time she just wanted to split us up. I stayed strong and just kept telling him I loved him and would always be there for him. After a week she was bored and got back with the other man she sees. This time he is already begining to doubt himself, he told me he thought he had been living a lie with me. I know those are not his words. Even if he was not in love with me anymore he would not try to say that what we had was not amazing, because even as he was breaking up with me he told me he loved me and what we had was special. She had told him she had changed and he believed her.
 
I have been reading about why abused people will go back to their abusers and it is heartbreaking, and although coercive control and emotional abuse are illegal in this country, i dont think there would be much evidence of it, and he is back under her control so would not say she had done anything. 

I realise this is an emotional request, and breaking people up for selfish reasons is not advised, however I don't think i could get back together with him. But I want him and his children to be safe from the emotional abuse. She won't change. She has had opportunity to and has only gotten worse.

One day I finished spraying the garden for bugs and went into the shed and cast the spell. The shed is next to my neighbors chickens.

In releasing that which stands in the way of true love.  
My heart is pure; my intentions clear. Please bring to me my most perfect partner.  
I seek a partner who enhances me by his/her very being.  
Who brings more love, joy, peace and prosperity to my life?  
Who I can love fully and who can fully receive my love,  
Who loves, honors and cherishes me completely, and always.  
May my heart be open and my head be clear.  
May my life be ready to welcome true love.  
May I be embraced in a circle of your love.  
And uplifted by your grace. And so it is.

For politics,5,cxh8gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/cxh8gc/for_politics/,2,1567201938.0,"I'm not sure what I'm looking for.  Maybe a spell, but really something more like a community or certain rituals that I can perform that would release my will and intention into the world counteracting all of the ugliness and corruption and turmoil of politics in my country (USA).  I constantly feel the urge to ""pray"" for positive outcomes and for people to be good to each other and do the right thing, but of course I don't ""pray"" in the traditional sense.  I do say the words in my head, like a prayer, but I'd prefer something more fitting to my own spiritual beliefs rather than adopting the form of prayer my Christian upbringing taught me.

I imagine it being not a full blown spell but more like a chant I can say in my mind, or a talisman I can touch when I want to ""pray"" for justice and peace in politics.    I've never seen anything like that or heard anybody mention it, so that's why I'm asking here.

Last Monday I took my little one to her gym class, after class my car wouldn‚Äôt start, suddenly it cranked, but a big check engine light was on, so I drove straight to my moms house and parked it. 4 hours later I took my moms vehicle to pick up my son from school, I (26) get in my first wreck, a guy hesitated at a yield sign and crossed 2 lanes of traffic and T-boned me. (I‚Äôm fine and car had a scratch), 2 days dealing with insurance and that chaos, 

Thursday I start to get ill (congestion mostly) and then my moms vehicles check engine light comes on (2019 vehicle so still under warranty, but still seriously?), 

Friday I get awful news that my car is going to take $2k to fix the engine and fuel line. (They fix it I get it back same day no other issues) 

Saturday I am minding my own, doing laundry, putting away towels in the linen closet and spot mold forming all the way across the ceiling of the closet, turns out I have a hole in my roof (townhouse HOA eats the cost of food repairs, but everything has to be thrown away from linen closet.)

To today Sunday, On the way to a family Sunday lunch it began to pour rain, I was rear ended at a stoplight. 2nd ever wreck happened 6 days after first... in the car that we just paid all of our savings to fix. 
Tonight I sat surrounded by my crystals and protection potion I made, and I cried. I released all this pent up bad energy and stress and I just released it. 

Is there any type of spell that you might share with me to help me undo whatever might have been cast upon me suddenly? Any tips or advice? I‚Äôm just at my wits end here. Thank you for your time.

It's to be invoked with kindness, compassion and if wanted love.   
I've used it when someone close to me has passed or when I‚Äôve felt a positive energy lingering around me. 

As grateful as I am when that happens, outside of a ritual or Sabbat I do not believe Spirits are meant to remain in the psychical world.

**PLEASE NOTE: this is not to be used as a protection spell, to ward a space or to expel anything that may want to cause harm.**

Step One: Light a candle after dusk near an open window. (Blue is recommended however White is fine)  
Step Two: Recite The Spirit's Guide  
Step Three: Allow the candle to burn out through the night

**The Spirits Guide**  
Little flame, burning bright  
Be a beacon on this night  
Light the path for all the dead  
So they may see what's now ahead  
Guide them to what lies beyond  
And shine until your flame has gone  
For with your light, please bring them peace  
That they may rest and sleep with ease.

Lately it‚Äôs been one bad thing after the next. 

1.) My hair has begun falling out, and despite going to get lab work that shows something is a little off, the dr‚Äôs office still hasn‚Äôt been able to find and read my results, despite the fact I walked the results in and handed them to the front desk 3 weeks ago

2.) just got 4 new tires and one is randomly going flat 

3.) Work has never been more stressful and every little project I work on goes sour one way or another 

4.) My relationship with my bf is very blah and strained recently because of work hours 

5.) I‚Äôm stuck in covid quarantine because my friend (who I guess isn‚Äôt a good friend?) didn‚Äôt tell me she knew she was in contact with someone who knew they were positive, both of which are still going about their life. 

So idk if this could all be chalked up to bad luck and hard times, or if someone is sending bad vibes my way.

Looking for help regaining sensation and possibly fighting off demons or leeches,6,ehsno6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ehsno6/looking_for_help_regaining_sensation_and_possibly/,19,1577770997.0,"I have a big problem that I'm pretty sure is energetic in nature and looking for some help. I have reason to believe that I let some kind of demon or leech in through meditation and psychedelic use. I opened myself up to spiritual beings and signed something, and I'm not sure what happened or how to fix it.

I'm missing a lot of sexual sensation. It started after I took an SSRI antidepressant and has continued for years after stopping. It's known as Post SSRI-discontinuation Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) and it is just becoming recognized by the medical community. There is no known cure or treatment.

I have other related problems - I had a prostate infection which left me with a lot of pelvic floor tension (Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome). I had an annual tear in one of my spinal disks causing nerve compression in the pelvic reason - I had surgery to fix that.

I've worked with energy workers who tell me I have a disturbance in that area, that they can feel it. I go to a physical therapist who works on that area as well. I see urologists and sexual medicine specialists, but no one can help me.

I meditate a lot and go on lengthy meditation retreats, and at one of them I did a spell consisting of repeatedly asking some kind of sexual spirit to cure me. It started to make me obsessed and distracted by thoughts of sex so I stopped.

I did a treatment with the psychedelic medicine ibogaine. While on this drug I asked any beings out there to help me, in desperation opening myself up to any spiritual entities and saying I'd do anything to be cured. When I did this I sensed something pushing what felt like a piece of paper towards me, and I put my hand forward and signed my name.

I talked to the ibogaine facilitators, and said I was really worried I'd signed a deal with an evil entity, and they told me this was Papa Iboga, a friendly plant spirit, and that nothing bad would happen to me.

But recently I talked to a witch who told me that plant spirits don't sign deals like that. She thought that when I did this I picked up a ""leech"" - some kind of energy-sucking entity. I told her that I couldn't possibly owe anything because they didn't stick to their end of the deal. ""Wrong my love,"" she said, claiming that they could still suck my energy away.

This witch also told me that she sensed a demon there. She said it was big and old and ugly and related to my sexual obsessions/addictions. I don't know if I agree that there's a demon there, but I want to get rid of any entities that might be there.

Context: I WAS manifesting my ex (while he was in a relationship) in the past but then I ended up liking someone else AND my ex did something shady to our friend. As a result, I instantly stopped caring. I was manifesting him for MONTHS and couldn‚Äôt let go and then two weeks of not thinking about him (or at least not thinking of him in an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù way. I was mad at what he did. Disgusted), him and his girlfriend break up. He tries talking to me and I won‚Äôt let him. He‚Äôs blocked on all social media (i still have his number because we work together but the second I graduate, his number is getting deleted and blocked). Then I hear that he‚Äôs saying that I‚Äôm his baby and he loves me blah blah blah and he goes on my other social media accounts and reacts to my post so I block again.


I do think of him but only the part where he hurt me. So I don‚Äôt miss him at all but I think about the hurt. So last night, I talked to my ancestors and I basically forgave him (and the girl he left me for) and I wanted them to live their best life.

Go to a cemetery, remove a nail from an old coffin, saying:

""Nails, I take you, so that you may serve to turn aside and cause evil to all persons whom I will.
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.""

When you wish to use it, you must look for a footprint and making the three figures of GULAND, SURGAT and MORAIL, fix the nail in the middle saying:

""Pater noster upto in terra.""(our father who art on earth)

Hit the nail with a stone, saying:

""Curse evil to (Name{s}) until I remove thee.""

Re-cover the place with a little dust, and remember it well, because one cannot remove the evil which this causes, but by removing the nail, and saying:

""I remove thee, so that the evil which thou has caused to (Name{s}) shall cease. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son. and the Holy Spirit. Amen.""

Then take the nail out, and efface the characters: not with the same hand as you make them, but with the other. Thus it will be without danger.

A stable/ permanent home for us, extra income for my grandparents/great grandmother, a great school system for my kids(the schools in her town are better than the ones in mine), keep the house in the family, put us closer to my extended family-which would allowe to help take care of my great grandmother and for my kids to spend more time with her while she is still here.

I don‚Äôt feel negatively impacted or fearful but it almost feels like someone is binding me or trying to work against me somehow. What could this be?

"Should consent always be requested for a healing spell, even if the person/s are religious?",5,hquqdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hquqdc/should_consent_always_be_requested_for_a_healing/,2,1594729075.0,"Hi everyone, I'm gonna cut right to the chase.. I'm a witch and I haven't done much magick in a while. I do NOT identify as Wiccan so please don't remind me about the Rede etc.. I'm very selective about what I send out into the Universe and my reasons for doing it. Now that we have that out of the way lol. My boyfriend asked me for the first time if I could work a healing spell for a friend of his (Jason) for his parents.. They're not super close though.

Long story short, they both have Covid. Both of them had to go to the hospital. The father is healing slowly, and the mother had to be sent back to the hospital from having a relapse of it... 

From what my partner has told me about them, they're all Christian. But they're good Christians, not the kind that shove their religion down your throat (I speak from experience of that). Good people. They're the type of people where if they were to receive an extra penny in change, they'll give it right back to you... 

Question is, do I really need consent to cast a healing spell on them? I did explain to my boyfriend that I would prefer to obtain consent than to just do it because energy work can have unpredictable outcomes even if you do everything right. Ask me how I know... I once made my own combination of a binding & truth spell on a family member. Boy did that give me more than I wanted... But it worked very quickly, I'm talking less than 24 hours quick. I got what I needed to hear though..

The tricky part is the parents of Jason are religious, but this is a serious situation for all involved, not just one but two of his parents are being harmed by this virus right now. You would assume he would say yes immediately if asked for consent at this point right?

Some questions on specific invocation and banishment,5,ejv1tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ejv1tf/some_questions_on_specific_invocation_and/,0,1578162211.0,"I read that overdoing banishments like LBRP can cause problems where you banish good things from your life also (for example https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/59d19y/practicing_daily_lbrp_problems/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/9ftyu5/message_for_beginners_on_the_lesser_banishing/e60d1my/) and that banishments need to be balanced out with invocations.

What I'd like to do, rather than a general banishment or invocation, is to make lists of specific things I want to banish and invoke in my life. Like the banishment list would include ""procrastination,"" ""demons,"" ""leeches,"" ""depression,"" etc., and the invocation list would include ""focus,"" ""organization,"" ""happiness,"" ""love,"" etc.

Are there good banishment and invocation spells that will allow me to select and specify in this manner? Can I use LIPR/LBPR for this?

Would I do the banishing and invoking just once a day each for each list all at once, or once for each item on each list?

How many items is too many? If I want to banish 10 and invoke 10 every day, is that doable?

Are there specific entities/deities I could use for everything, or would it be better to choose a specific and appropriate entity for each item separately? Can I, for instance ""invoke the spirit of organization""? Does that exist?

Can I use Buddha for everything? He is said in the Buddhist scriptures, if you accept those, to be the most powerful, greater than all the gods.

Is it true for benefits you gain from spell you often take something away from another person?,4,h9s8kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h9s8kg/is_it_true_for_benefits_you_gain_from_spell_you/,2,1592294923.0,"I was told by a veteran witch to be careful about spellcasting because every benefit you get be it gaining a suitcase of luggage or having sex with a gorgeous girl and gaining physical strength all come from somewhere else (often indirectly stealing from another person). For example if you cast a money spell and found $50 on the ground in the next day............. That $50 was probably lost by someone while he or she was traveling. It didn't just pop out of thin air. For all we know  the person was a girl who needed that cash to get  taxi fare home. Because she somehow lost that 50 bucks as a result of the spell, she had to travel home. She could have been grabbed from behind, dragged to the bushes, and raped. Or she could have slipped and fallen on broken glass and hurt. If nothing dangerous happens at all, she still has to walk home. Maybe she gets lucky after she realizes she has no fare when she attempts to call for a nearby Taxi in traffic but her brother happens to also be in the same traffic line and sees her and calls on her to just join him and save cash. Whatever the results, she still lost $50.

A more worldly example can be seen by a quote the witch sent me in the chatroom.

>If I see a gorgeous girl on a street corner, and want to go do some kind of work to cause her to run over and sleep with me, the butterfly effect is in play. Let's say she does immediately run over to me.

>Let's say there is a man driving a car through the intersection who normally would have slowed to look at the girl, but since I tilted the machine, she isn't there. The guy coming the other way that runs the red light would have missed this man if she were there, but since she isn't, there is a horrific, T-bone wreck. The car rolls. It badly injures both drivers, and brutally kills an innocent 4 year old girl right in front of her mother, just for being on the sidewalk.

>How much of that is my fault? I didn't run the red light, I didn't tell the mother and daughter to go for a walk... The LHP answer is it wouldn't be my fault, because everyone is just doing their thing and shit happens. My answer is a good chunk is my fault. I didn't run the red light, but I tilted the fucking machine because I knew how and just wanted something for myself, and most people are stuck just playing with the 2 bottom paddles. If I hadn't done that, there would be no accident. I also know what I am doing, I know tilting the machine is unfairly slanting things in my favor, and that makes a higher standard apply to me. I know what I am doing and I know better.

BTW the witch is actually female but she was using the above example to me since I'm a guy to help me understand better how an innocent spell like finding a friend with benefits can have devastating consequences lol!

But still is what she warns against a legitimate part of sorcery and a basic functioning of spellcasting? For example if I'm having bad health issues because of old age and cast a spell and a week later I somehow regain my youthful athleticism, was that bodybuilder energy taken from someone else,probably a young guy in the military? As a result he fails PT and gets discharged, meaning he loses his house and his family suffers as a result with his kids starving and homeless?

I am very curious and her warning is why I am hesitate to do spellcasting right now! How true is her statement?",spells
How do aerosol sprays of traditional herbs and other ingredients and potions work?,2,h8g4k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h8g4k3/how_do_aerosol_sprays_of_traditional_herbs_and/,1,1592112044.0,"I just bought Dr. Pastor Davis John the Conqueror and Attraction aerosol sprays from the local occult shop.

Do I spray it daily in my room? Will opening the window lead to the effect going away via air leaving the window? Can I spray them on talisman and other items to transfer its specific effects? How long does the effects last after spraying a room or object or person? Does spraying two different substances in the same location potentially complement each or other or cancel each other out and stuff of that sort?

word craft and intention,3,e6yce0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/e6yce0/word_craft_and_intention/,6,1575665344.0,"So I found a 'spell to get someone ro stop contacting me' thread and a bunch ralked about words and intentions. It made me think about the spells that I have cast, or have been working on.

Ones a sweetening jar. I put all the ingredients in, did the spell work surrounding it to give the jar energy. The one thing I didn't do was speak. I got all the positive feelings I could via memories and music. Even up to today when I burn a red candle in the jar I pour my intention into what I want to happen, say a little prayer to Freya thanking her and adking her to watch over my working, but then go and do other stuff till the whole candle melts down.

I also work on a vinegar jar spell. Same idea. Shake up the jar, say a prayer, burn a candle. But I'm not saying what I want to happen or what to do. Maybe that's why I haven't been seeing any results. 

Can some one help me find the words to go with the intention? The vinegar jar spell is to brake up an abusive controlling relationship. 

The sweetening jar spell is to create or repair the friendship or relationship between the target and I that was severed from the toxic relationship that the vingar jar spell is to end.

I even wrote something down to say for the vingar jar spell. I don't have direct access to it right now, but if I remember correctly it goes while shaking the vingar jar: "" (name) and (name) the relationship I'm here to shatter, in the end it doesn't matter. The two of you are done today, now go both your separate ways. So mote it be."" Short and sweet. 

Not so much for the sweetening jar spell. Regardless am I just doing some things wrong? Do I need to go and revamp and add things in?

Why is real life sorcery so boring compared to D and D and Harry Potter divine powers found in fiction? Why doesn't real life have magick that allows Force Lightning in Star Wars or Charmed's Piper Freeze Time Ability?,3,fdz0wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fdz0wv/why_is_real_life_sorcery_so_boring_compared_to_d/,6,1583459455.0,"Saw this conversation on Discord.

>While we are at it, a question I've had with TechEmporium. An exact message I sent on a few discord rooms.
>
A frequent point me a TechEmporiun frequently discuss is......... If Magick is real why don't we see fireballs being shot out of people's hands? Or people chanting a name and an earthquake happens?

>This is proof of mass hysteria according to scientiffic magician and he says all occultists and even Christians from Linah at NightHouse to Geno at Occult and Chill to RCR917 and Bassackwards all are buying into.

>There is no ""harry potter"" magick where you wave a wand around and suddenly you create a ray of light that can burn someone according to atheist magician.
Even when people describe incidents where magical stuff appear, nothing is anywhere close to say Super Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z destroying buildings because they shoot out energy blasts or Kenpachi cutting a skyscraper in half with a single sword swing or FOrce Lightning style attacks where electricity literally comes out of your finger tips like Emperor Palpatine.

>Its more boring mundane magick by fictional standards like flying hammers and such. Even by something as more low level and earthly as Charmed, the magic supposed veterans like Xaithu, RCR917, Geno, and Monster at the NIghthouse Discord room encounter is low level like a ceiling collapsing. Not freezing time like Piper could and Force telekenesis liek Prue could or seeing distant future visions like Phoebe could. Nothing that Charmed Halliwell's sister at all.

>I have to ask why even the real magickal stuff is nothing like Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons?
Its for this reason why TechEmporium says all magick is BS and its all just altering your brain's chemical function. He says if D and D magick was real like Zeus throwing lightning, how supposed apparitions like Zeus doesn't shock his opponent with force lightning? Or supposed appearance of Santa Muerte causes instant death to people who anger her in summoning by a black aura spreading in a room like a horror movie?
I'm just so curious how claims like reading minds Jean Grey style or faster than light speed common in anime/manga fights come from? Why mythology is full of them and even the Abrhaamic religionst oo? Yet from people interactions with the gods and demons and whatever the real story is far more boring?

>Can humans actually learn how to control a river to do whipping attacks using water like in some fantasy Wuxia martial arts films and make the earth shake by stomping their foot on the ground and cracking the floor in front of you split wide open like Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender can do? And other D and D style magick?If so how come no occultists have done so in modern times?

I am quite curious why real life magick is so boring and seems to work more by coincidences and laws of science? None of that shooting ray of destructive light out of your finger tip like in YuYu Hakusho and other stuff the Discorder stated in the quote above? Why is it just boring candles that simply tips the balance in say business dealings or subconsciously changes your habit through placebo effect and accessing psychological archetypes?

Even the cases we have of demonic attachment and stuff and defying the science, the magick is so low level like causing a keychain to levitate. We don't have stuff that is close to fictional powerful like Prue waving her arms and destroying an entire room in Charmed or Gandalf using his staff to bring out a sphere of light that blinds an entire battalion of American marines for over 10 minutes! The stuff we have is mostly boring low stuff like bleeding out of nowhere when meeting an angel or someone being lifted midair by an angry spirit. Or feeling the energy of a person (but not necessarily reading his thoughts like Jean Grey in X-Men could).

Am I cursed with Lycanthropy?,2,gwtvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwtvjp/am_i_cursed_with_lycanthropy/,15,1591345408.0,"Greetings, reddit. As you can see, my post is going to be a weird one, that's why I made a completely new reddit account, I never told anyone about what happens to me and there are close people that are checking my main reddit account and I don't want them to find about this yet. Also, English is not my native language so expect some spelling mistakes here and there. I have no idea who I can ask about this stuf honestly...

I never believed in paranormal stuff or curses but I can't ignore what's been happening for the past few years. I know I am not yet very convincing but hear me out, I am genuinely scared and paranoid. Every once in a while, I wake up in the morning really sweaty finding my blankets and pillows all thrown on the floor of my bedroom. I usually sleep naked but there were times when I didn't sleep naked and woke up with my tee either very enlarged (like when you try to pull the collar apart but you fail tearing your t-shirt) or torn.

Sometimes I even find food thrown away in random spots in my flat and the door of the fridge open and everything inside watery (I once had to buy another fridge as the old just stopped functioning properly). My neighbours that live in the same apartment block sometimes think that I am moving doing my workouts or dancing in the middle of the night as they can hear loud bumps coming from my flat (that only happens in the nights prior to these weird mornings) . I'm ashamed to say that sometimes I even find urine marks in the corners.

Another neighbour that is on the same level as me once threw a party in his flat and when people went past my door sometimes they would hear 'a dog growling but not barking' . When he told me that I couldn't control my emotions and I had a cringe-worthy reaction as I am usually a very anxious person and I can't just make up lies without shaking when I'm telling them, let alone when I am face to face with a person that I have to suddenly lie to. I just told him that I had to look after my girlfriend's dog in the end, but it was still weird and he didn't tell me anything about any growling since. (My girlfriend is studying in a different city, close to mine as we're both uni students and she's coming to my place from time to time).

But another old lady that is also my neighbour and leaves at the first level of my block said that the stray dogs from outside bark most of the night. (I know that they do that only or at least mostly when the episodes occur because I meet her in the mornings when I go to uni walking her dog and she always tells me to be careful because there can still be aggressive stray dogs around from last night).    I've considered that I might be sleep walking, but I've never been sleeping walking in my entire life and I never knew how I could check if I am.

I've considered having night-surveillance cameras, but there are multiple issues here: 1. My parents still buy stuff for me and that fridge was also expensive. They usually have to know what I need money for.                        2.  I could use my phone or just a regular old camera that can film, but they don't have a night-view mode and they can just run out of battery. I've got an iPhone and it's screen just locks automatically after a minute. Even if I disable that feature, iphones really run out of battery really fast, I tried filming for half an hour and its battery was dead afterwards.                       3. I am scared of what I would see. Even if it's just sleepwalking. I've seen other videos of that with people just talking in their beds with their eyes open and that was still creepy. Let alone me growling, pissing and doing all that mess when I never ever done that in my life (I casually asked my parents at one point if I used to sleepwalk when I was really young and they said that I didn't).

Obviously, I've seen a lot of stories/myths about lycanthropy and I was really creeped out. I am curious if you guys believe in such things. These episodes don't happen regularly (and yes, without exaggerating, they did happen on full-moon nights as well).

I am curious about your opinions. Am I way too paranoid? I've only anonymously asked a witch from my country about her opinion on my issue and she suggested I may be a werewolf and since then I'm paranoid and there's just anxiety everytime I try to sleep.

I tried making this post as easy to read so possible. Feel free to ask for more details. It's the weirdest thing in my life and I genuinely don't know who I can ask about this. Thank you for your time!

Spell for making someone more into you?,0,diuvcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/diuvcc/spell_for_making_someone_more_into_you/,7,1571284957.0,"  Okay, before anything I really want you guys not to judge me. But I really have a crush on my friend's mother. That's right, my friend's mom. I just have the desire to stay with her one night, but nothing more than that. Are there any spells who can help me with that? Of course, I don't want spells that will FORCE her to stay with me, I just want something to make her look at me differently, not a friendly look, more like a sexual look.

  I think someone might ask this, but I'm going to answer right away:

She's not married, she's single. And she likes me, but as a friend, I want to change that. Sometimes she asks me for advice on her son (my friend), which means she trusts me, but as a friend.",spells

Anyway him calling me the very next day after casting the spell confused me because again we haven‚Äôt spoken in over 3 months so it made me wonder was the love spell working or was this just a coincidence. Anyway a few days went by and we text but didn‚Äôt speak and I decided to write him a long message basically telling him how I feel and asked him if he would consider giving us another chance, I told him if he says No then I‚Äôm willing to accept it which I really am. Which brings my question out of desperation I did the love spell, if the love spell is working then how can I break it? Because although I really want him back I want it to be of his freewill, and also do love spells with this fast or is it just a coincidence?

Some questions on specific invocation and banishment,4,ejv1tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ejv1tf/some_questions_on_specific_invocation_and/,0,1578162211.0,"I read that overdoing banishments like LBRP can cause problems where you banish good things from your life also (for example https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/59d19y/practicing_daily_lbrp_problems/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/9ftyu5/message_for_beginners_on_the_lesser_banishing/e60d1my/) and that banishments need to be balanced out with invocations.

What I'd like to do, rather than a general banishment or invocation, is to make lists of specific things I want to banish and invoke in my life. Like the banishment list would include ""procrastination,"" ""demons,"" ""leeches,"" ""depression,"" etc., and the invocation list would include ""focus,"" ""organization,"" ""happiness,"" ""love,"" etc.

Are there good banishment and invocation spells that will allow me to select and specify in this manner? Can I use LIPR/LBPR for this?

Would I do the banishing and invoking just once a day each for each list all at once, or once for each item on each list?

How many items is too many? If I want to banish 10 and invoke 10 every day, is that doable?

Are there specific entities/deities I could use for everything, or would it be better to choose a specific and appropriate entity for each item separately? Can I, for instance ""invoke the spirit of organization""? Does that exist?

Can I use Buddha for everything? He is said in the Buddhist scriptures, if you accept those, to be the most powerful, greater than all the gods.

Looking for help regaining sensation and possibly fighting off demons or leeches,4,ehsno6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ehsno6/looking_for_help_regaining_sensation_and_possibly/,19,1577770997.0,"I have a big problem that I'm pretty sure is energetic in nature and looking for some help. I have reason to believe that I let some kind of demon or leech in through meditation and psychedelic use. I opened myself up to spiritual beings and signed something, and I'm not sure what happened or how to fix it.

I'm missing a lot of sexual sensation. It started after I took an SSRI antidepressant and has continued for years after stopping. It's known as Post SSRI-discontinuation Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) and it is just becoming recognized by the medical community. There is no known cure or treatment.

I have other related problems - I had a prostate infection which left me with a lot of pelvic floor tension (Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome). I had an annual tear in one of my spinal disks causing nerve compression in the pelvic reason - I had surgery to fix that.

I've worked with energy workers who tell me I have a disturbance in that area, that they can feel it. I go to a physical therapist who works on that area as well. I see urologists and sexual medicine specialists, but no one can help me.

I meditate a lot and go on lengthy meditation retreats, and at one of them I did a spell consisting of repeatedly asking some kind of sexual spirit to cure me. It started to make me obsessed and distracted by thoughts of sex so I stopped.

I did a treatment with the psychedelic medicine ibogaine. While on this drug I asked any beings out there to help me, in desperation opening myself up to any spiritual entities and saying I'd do anything to be cured. When I did this I sensed something pushing what felt like a piece of paper towards me, and I put my hand forward and signed my name.

I talked to the ibogaine facilitators, and said I was really worried I'd signed a deal with an evil entity, and they told me this was Papa Iboga, a friendly plant spirit, and that nothing bad would happen to me.

But recently I talked to a witch who told me that plant spirits don't sign deals like that. She thought that when I did this I picked up a ""leech"" - some kind of energy-sucking entity. I told her that I couldn't possibly owe anything because they didn't stick to their end of the deal. ""Wrong my love,"" she said, claiming that they could still suck my energy away.

This witch also told me that she sensed a demon there. She said it was big and old and ugly and related to my sexual obsessions/addictions. I don't know if I agree that there's a demon there, but I want to get rid of any entities that might be there.

I'd really like help determining if there are any demons or leeches on me, if I'm in trouble for signing a deal with an entity, and how I can cure this lack of sensation or energetic problem related to sex.

I found a couple spells posted by /u/Rimblesah that seem good:

I had a tarot reading with a spiritual reader. He not only reads tarot cards but he can feel energies and communicate with spirits. 

During my reading we discussed many things about my life which was pretty positive until I asked about a specific member of my childrens family. He told me that she had been doing witchcraft against me and he immediately said yes (i didn‚Äôt want to know what exactly just how to protect myself). This was obviously worrying but made sense as there had been somethings happening that I couldn‚Äôt explain before.


He told me in order to protect myself I needed to get a doll that resembled me, an amethyst crystal, rosemary and cut my nail or hair and put them all together in a small black drawstring bag. I would have to sleep with this bag under my pillow for seven days. On the seventh day I would need to bury it until a plant or something that would eventually grow roots under it which would form this protection. 

On the seventh day I went to bury it. But found myself in a situation. The place I had gone to bury it was in my community garden but I was not expecting anyone to be there as I‚Äôd gone in the night. There was a woman there that refused to let me be there as she believed I didn‚Äôt live there even though I did. A man then came to kick me out. He pushed me and the woman spat on me on top of many insults like hoping I would get coronavirus. It was terrible. I had not had an experience like this since I was child and it was a quite traumatic. I believe this was a spiritual attack. Why would this happen on a day I was supposed to finalise this protection spell? 

Anyways I left, found somewhere else to bury it and then went home. The next day it rained so I felt like it was a good sign, the plant was given something to help it grow over.

After two days I went back to where I‚Äôd buried it to check on it and I noticed a hole where the bag was. Someone had taken it. I cannot believe it. Who would do this? And why? Especially after seeing the contents surely they would just put it back? But no. It had completely disappeared and I could not see it anyway in the area. I felt shaken and afraid that someone could do something bad with it which would directly affect me. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly for days. I also couldn‚Äôt get into contact with the reader either so it‚Äôs fair to say I‚Äôve been worried ever since. 

Please can someone advice me on what to do next?

Should I leave it alone?

Should I do the ritual again?

Should I do something else?

I would really appreciate any positive answers as I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone in my life about this as the people around me would not approve of this. 

Thank you in advance!

Now my emails are flooded with the aftermath of what happens after cutting off a narcissist. I think this is a warning. But I don't want to underestimate the level he will go to.

I was considering return to sender and protection spells for me. 

Doing research on spells, the right herbs, the timing, and candles.

Black or purple candle
Waxing moon time or during a Tuesday Ares.
No spell yet.
Herbs rosemary, cloves, still working on 
Oils grave yard dirt I also bought goddess Kali oil but haven't used it or dont want to upset goddess Kali. I can prayer to her but at no point do I use deitys or gods. My safety is ancestors, elements, and guardian angels.

About a year and a half ago terrible things started happening to me and my partner. We have friends into the occult and it seems these bad things happen around then or after seeing them. I got an awful job that caused serious mental harm no matter how hard I tried. My favorite necklace went missing after said friend complimented it. My partner ended up breaking a bone and having a terrible experience at the hospital, my cat died a few weeks after they stayed with us. I got diagnosed with a somewhat rare disease that‚Äôs done awful things to my body. I had a terrible trip on drugs and the first person I felt like I had to call was those same friends vs other friends that are closer to me. After video chatting with them my other favorite necklace went missing after they complimented it again. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd lose it when I‚Äôve barely left the house. I‚Äôve also been having the most terrible time at work and had multiple emotional breakdowns and can‚Äôt seem to do anything right since the bad trip, but that could be due to the pandemic and the terrible systematic racism we have in the world. 

I‚Äôve been having nightmares and most recently I had a walking stick cactus monster in it that was extremely bizarre. In the same dream my brother died and I woke up crying. He has been sick the last few weeks but teeth pain and a pinched nerve in his back, nothing serious. 

Today, out of no where, I felt I might have been cursed and had a weird feeling. I usually don‚Äôt believe in these things but it just kind of clicked in my mind. I feel crazy even typing this out which is why I‚Äôm on an alt account. Any thoughts on if this could be one or not?

## Money-Doubling Spell

This is a simple spell used to double any denomination of paper money. You must have the money physically in your hands in order to cast this spell to double it.

1. First, take those fresh notes of paper money (in any denomination‚Äîthe larger the denomination, the higher the reward). You may use more than one note if you wish.
2. Place these bills in a new white envelope, then seal the envelope. Fold the envelope in half (folding towards you) and chant:  
‚ÄúPowers that be, to me shall bring,  
The means to double this sum.  
Hear me, you spirits which sing,  
Quickly, and gently come.‚Äù
3. Do this once every day for seven days. As you chant, hold the envelope up in front of you and envision the envelope getting heavier. Keep the envelope full of notes in your bedroom when you are not casting the spell.
4. After you‚Äôve received the money, open the envelope and spend or deposit the money in the envelope.

If you want to cast this spell again, you must use a new set of bills and envelope.",spells

My Dark Spell Story (a warning to all),21,dakhib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/dakhib/my_dark_spell_story_a_warning_to_all/,5,1569727197.0,"This is the story about the time I practiced black magic. let it be a warning to all those who are inexperienced and who are dabbling In the dark arts!

When I was young and I met my husband, I was extremely jealous of his ex-girlfriend. I made a Spell (which I will not give the exact details on as I do not share my spells with anyone) using dark magic to make her suffer.

You see, my husband's ex has goofy and large front teeth. My verse for the spell included a line that mentioned her teeth. I poured all of my intent and malice into this spell. I repeated three times that I wanted bad karma or bad luck to come on her x 3.

3 days went by with no sign of any change. Then on day three I started having intense toothache. it was so bad that I could not sleep and I was banging my head against the wall just to distract myself from the pain. The next morning (day two) I stumbled into the dentists office and they pulled that tooth out. Day 3 came and where the hole existed, where the tooth once was, there was a extremely painful and foul smelling infection that had set in. It was so bad that I had to go into hospital. The infection has spread to my wisdom tooth. I had to undergo surgery to remove my wisdom tooth. I thought that was the end of it. But then where they had removed my wisdom tooth another infection began to take hold. I did extreme cleansing ritual at that point. I sat in a bath of salt water and repeatedly I said a verse that was reversing the initial spell. The next morning the infection was gone and everything was back to normal.

The black magic that I had foolishly practiced had turned on me and back fired thrice! After that I learnt my lesson and I never practice in intentions in magic spells anymore.

My point of this story is to warn anyone who is starting out with magic to be very cautious and remember that there is karma for everything that you put out in this world.",spells

"Honey jar spell, I believe it works",30,hpcvvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hpcvvi/honey_jar_spell_i_believe_it_works/,8,1594513717.0,"Did it twice, it worked the first time and I disposed of the contents of that jar. Because reasons. It took around a week or so for me to see the results. From that point on, it's up to you to continue with what the honey jar spell has started. For me, I did not continue with what the spell made after disposing of the contents.

The second time I did it, kinda manifested around the same time as the first one. I won't dispose of it yet and see how far it will take me. I'm still kinda waiting for something else to happen that's why.

So here's what I did, I lit a red candle(you can use pink or both candles) then wrote a petition. The petition is written in the present tense. No wishing, just wrote things that I want to happen in the present tense. Like ""love is always with me"". Folded it up, added some of the candle wax on the paper to ""seal"" it  and placed it in the glass jar. Filled it with honey, cinnamon powder and brown sugar. On top of the lid, I placed the lit candle(or both if you used 2) and let it burn. While it is burning, I stared at the flame and kept my heart and mind focused on what I want. Place it somewhere only you can touch and see it so that you can put your energy to it everytime.

Here are some other stuff that you can add too. These are optional which I believe will strengthen the spell. You can add photos, write runes across the petition and put other herbs(herbs/plants that represent love). You can also make your own chant/prayer while holding the jar to add energy to it. Do it as frequent as you can and have love in your heart while doing it.

The best thing is that you believe that it will work. Don't let your feelings of love falter. It may take some more time for others or it may take less. You'll see or feel the results. For me, before the events happened, I felt very uneasy like I'm super anxious and nervous. Then after a few hours, it happened. Not gonna say what, but something happened that involves the spell.

Anyway, I believe any honey jar spell will work as long as your intentions and belief on it is strong and it will manifest. Good luck to all of you and I hope this helps you too. I wish you all the best.",spells

"Energy Work to help you in the COVID ""panic""",38,fjl6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjl6pq/energy_work_to_help_you_in_the_covid_panic/,0,1584395147.0,"An ER nurse in the r/energy_work forum asked what she can do to help deal with both the medical dangers, but also the dark and panicky energy she's surrounded by during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to share my ideas here too, in case any of you are worried or affected.  


\*\*\*  
If you can wear a quartz crystal then put it into a bowl of salt every time you go home and take it off, that will help. You can also wear hematite, tiger eye, sunstone, and obsidian. I know  that a necklace may not be allowed in the ER but even an ankle bracelet would help. Just have the stones on your person somewhere. All those stones do well to absorb negativity. To add in positive mood energy, wear or carry amethyst and rose quartz.

Next, I know you won't want to wear TOO much perfume, but if you can put some lavender oil, calendula (marigold) oil, and citrus essential oil on your pulse points, that would help.Consider dressing your helper stones and crystal with that oil as well.

On your break, go outside if you can and put your back against a stone or tree. Even a stone or brick wall can help. Feel yourself ""melting"" into the tree or stone. Feel the calm stable strength of it. Let energy reach down into the earth along with the tree roots or the foundation of the wall or stone. Let your energy extend up out of your fingertips like branches. To an outsider it will just look like you raise up your arms and have a good stretch so don't be embarrassed what others may think.Take a deep breath in through your nose and just push/dump/drain all the energy in your body down through your feet into the ground. Then take another breath and breathe in fresh energy, pulling it down from the sky and the clouds and the air. Do that 3 times total. If you know how to shield, then finish by putting your auric shields back up.

The next thing I do is sit in a few minutes of meditation while charging my stones and magickal tools. I imagine a roaring hot campfire, too hot to sit next to. I feel the heat on my face and hands, I see the flickering light. I hear the wood popping and snapping in the flames and the rush of the hot air rising, the low roar of the fire. I try to smell the good spicy musky woodsmoke scent.

It's ok to use a candle, a fireplace, or just a video of a campfire, to help visualize. Then I imagine myself being hollow and light, as if my bones were hollow conduits. And I ""reach out"" energetically and pull that campfire into me. As if my belly was the fireplace and my chest and throat and head were the chimney. I sit there for a few minutes and try to become fire. 

This is AMAZING for your immune system. I have a stage IV terminal cancer and after multiple rounds of chemo my oncologist keeps saying ""I have no idea how your white blood cell count and platelets and hematocrit look this good with the chemo cocktail you are on, but whatever you're doing just keep doing it.""  


A similar meditation is to lie looking up into the starry night sky and feel yourself drifting up into it. Drift among the stars, then drift over to one. Feel the incredible power of the giant furnace of the star, then pull it into yourself and have a hot yellow-white sun burning inside your 3rd chakra, in your belly. You can even do a galaxy! That's less good for immune system, but good for protection, and great for grabbing a huge pile of energy to use to create a reality or heal others.   


Using the same technique, toss a mint bath bomb down in your shower and stand under the coolest temperature water that still feels good. Become waterfall. Become crashing waves. This is good for clearing out emotional energy that doesn't belong to you.  


All day at work, every time things get crazy, take one second to just \*feel\* that fire in your lower chakras roar up, like throwing a log on a campfire.

Learn the Cho Ku Rei symbol. Pull a ball of that fire energy into your hand and sneakily draw the symbol on anything that needs some darn powerful healing, fast. You can also google and learn the Se He Ki symbol and draw it anytime you feel in danger or on anything that seems to need protection. You don't need to be attuned to Reiki energy in order to use those symbols - they work fine to direct ANY healing energy.

Consider hopping into r/ReikiPractitioners and asking if you could be given Reiki attunements. It CAN be done even from a distance on a video call, in some traditions. Energy healing disregards physical distance in many ways. Reiki could do a lot to protect you, and also to save patients that might otherwise not do as well. I like to think of Reiki as that one small weight on the scale to tip the balance - if you're kinda getting sick, but your immune system is also kinda fighting it off, Reiki is SO GOOD at giving things that little ""shove"" so you fight off a cold instead of catching it.  And similar situations. If a person is in the balance, and they 50/50 might make it, or might not, Reiki is the energy work ""tool"" needed there IMO.",spells

She pulled out a bottle of clear oil and a seed that looked like a Eugenia uniflora cherry seed. This lady told us all we have to do is place the bottle of oil ( which we had to write words on that I never seen before)at the corner of people doors and place the seed on top of the bottle. Then we had to knock at the door and stay close enough to not be seen but to watch. After the person opens the door and look down at the seed it would glow and the person will walk back into their home. Once the person went back into the house we will go back to where the seed was placed and money would appear in place of the seed. The lady said each seed would turn into $300 dollars. I was hesitant at first and watched someone else do it first before I did it myself. Once I saw that it worked the lady told me she will give me a seed that would give me 3√ó the amount. I kept trying to look for a house to place the seed but had difficulty finding the right spot to watch the door so I came across a stand alone mirror that was slightly out of frame and decided to place the oil bottle at the corner of the mirror and the seed in between the mirror and frame opening. The seed started to glow and I saw a shadow in the mirror moving back in forth. The shadow man figure laid a old antique hair clip that had four lines on the floor in front of the mirror. I picked it up to see 4 different type of bills on each line. He was telling me that some of the dollar bill's was from 1900s and worth more now when I trade it but one of the dollars had a date of 2026 and had a black man on it that was tall and slim and scary. I dont think this bill was from the USA, more like a island.The shadow told me this man killed many and died by decapitation.

Broomstick Spell,21,jbs5gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/jbs5gs/broomstick_spell/,1,1602811868.0,"So many witch hunters claimed that women rubbed their broomsticks with ergot and then used them on their feminine parts, showing the evil inherent in women for being overly sexual and ‚Äòflying‚Äô. The broomstick really should be a symbol of revolt by witches and warlocks alike.

I have faced so much criticism, cynicism, and general abuse for being a witch. When at its worst I can think that we are no better off than during the witch hunts of old.

The main complaint that I get is that I am using stupid gullible people (to what end hasn‚Äôt been explained to me yet) and that it is against God‚Äôs Law (whatever THAT is)

So in order to con the gullible (if you consider yourselves to be so?) and go against God‚Äôs (undefined) law, I made a samhain video about broomsticks, their folk lore and how to use them. Many witches have asked me this as Sweeping Magic is great for many many different uses and my latest offering tries to address the rituals and rites you would use a broomstick for....... as well as can you fly on them...........!

Thought I'd share a spell which I performed last new moon which has been working really well for me. It can also be performed on a Wednesday (Mercury - Commerce) during a waxing moon (growth period).

Ingredients: 1 Charcoal Disk in a fireproof dish & Benzoin resin granules / Matches / Chopped Basil (dried or fresh) / 1 green candle (I'd recommend no less than 6hr burn time) / 1 yellow candle / 1 Small broom or hand brush / Large bunch fresh Rosemary / 2 yards twine or string / 30cm string of dried juniper berries / 6 drops of mint essential oil

Casting the Spell:

1. Cast the circle (search the sub if you are not sure how, there will be other instructions for how to open / close a circle)
2. Light the charcoal disk and sprinkle on the Benzoin & Basil
3. Light the green candle and say ""Earth, witness this spell"". Light the yellow candle and say ""Air, carry it well""
4. Tie the Rosemary around the handle of the brush, then wrap the twine around until it is completely used, chanting as you do: ""Born of earth, carried in air, increase worth, away with care"". Fasten it off then tie the string of berries around the twine.
5. Anoint the handle & brush with the Mint oil. Pass the brush over the incense smoke 3 times, saying ""Once I invest thee, Twice I impress thee, Thrice I then bless thee"". Leave the brush with the candles until they burn out.
6. Keep the brush over the doorway of your business (I work from home so keep mine over my front door)

Hope this is useful for someone. Let me know if you have any q's. The spell is taken from the book 'The Spells Bible' by Ann-Marie Gallagher.

Blood Magick for Healing Spell?,11,iscgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iscgpr/blood_magick_for_healing_spell/,5,1600080405.0,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to make this as brief as I can. My partner was recently diagnosed with having UVH (Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction). It's a bit rare compared to BVH, and we're pretty young. To break it down, UVH is when one ear stops communicating proper signals to the brain, which then compromises one's sense of balance. It basically feels like you're drunk all the time, but without any of the good feelings from it. At least that's how my partner puts it. It might be permanent, but it might go away on its own within several weeks. Currently what we're able to do is some physical therapy exercises to retrain the nerve to properly communicate with his brain.

However, I've been thinking about working a spell for my partner that may help the healing process, even if I can reduce the dizziness for him too. And that's why I wanted to know if its a good idea to use blood magick (a prick of the finger really) to amplify the healing spell. I will more than likely get a strand or two of his hair as well to make the spell as specific for him as I possibly can. 

I've never included blood magick in my spells before, because I know it's very powerful. I don't include certain things in my energy work unless I know I've done my research for it.

Thoughts? Have any of you ever done blood magick to help amplify a healing spell? How'd it turn out? I'd really appreciate some stories. Thanks in advance!",spells

Let the water rinse away the tough outer shell you have built through these survival mechanisms.  Let the water leave you bare, naked and vulnerable, cleansed of facade and receptive to change.

Dry off, but don‚Äôt apply any moisturizers/creams/after shower routine.  Find a nice place to be alone with a mirror, behind closed doors (full length mirror is best).  Dim the lights and work by candlelight if that best sets the tone.

Cast a circle/sacred space/raise energy in the way that fits your tradition, but without using tools ‚Äî only your body, your mind, and your spiritual connections.

If you work with divine feminine or nurturing spirits, call on them at this time to work through you.

Place an oil, salve or cream that you use in your magical practice (the one tool) on the palms of your hands, rub them together slowly and open up the channel between you and your concept of the divine/spiritual mother.  Continue to work your hands until your hands are her hands and no longer your own.

Disrobe infront of the mirror, and have the courage to not look away.  Confront the parts of your body that unsettle you, scare you, or make you feel ashamed.  For each part, think about:

1) What is the nature of this feeling?

2) What are the thoughts that lead to it?

3) What external places do these thoughts come from?  Media, judgmental family members, societal norms or pressures?

Remember: your hands are now HER hands.  She is with you.  Use your hands to comfort you in the way a mother would.  If things get too intense, turn away from the mirror and re-center your mind on her presence before returning to the mirror. 

On the part of your body that you are focusing on, rub the oil into your skin, with gentle and loving motions like a mother figure would.  Call upon your nurturing spirits or divine feminine to act through your hands to bless this part of you and to remind you that it is holy, beautiful and powerful.  Trace your sacred symbols with your hands over this part, taking your time.

Apply more oil to the rest of your skin, like you would a moisturizer.  Replace the space left behind by removing your hard outer shell with the oil/salve as a renewing and protecting layer of the divine feminine.  Take a long time with this, giving extra attention where needed.

Conclude by paying extra attention on the area of your chest/heart (or where you feel the most tension).

Now, place your body in the positions of any divine poses you know, such as those depicted in statues of your tradition.  If you don‚Äôt know any, ask the divine feminine you work with to teach one to you, or create a pose that represents beauty, power, magic or motherhood.  In the mirror, realize the beauty that you have created with your own body.

At this time, do what you feel most compelled to ‚Äî close the circle, thank your spirits, journal about the experience, divine, craft, meditate more deeply on the thoughts/feelings that arose, do something that makes you feel powerful, sleep, have an ugly cry, watch the AOC makeup video ‚Äî all are valid!

Over the next few days, take some time to research depictions &amp; descriptions of divine, spiritual, mythological women through history and across cultures, such as:

[Ancient Venus figurines of Europe](https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/france-venus-figurines.jpg)

I added salt, eggshell,  basil, chamomile, tumeric and black pepper. I ALSO added red rosebuds and a forget-me-not.

I am only looking for advice. 

This morning I woke up to find that my spare car key had been stolen. I don't want to go into details, but I think they are probably planning on coming back to steal my car, bc why else would they steal the keys? I have done all there is to do in the mundane, police are useless, as usual. 

In my head, I'm thinking of creating a three part spell/ritual,
- to make the key uncomfortable for them to touch (my initial thought is make a clay or wooden key and put in a fire, while chanting something like their guilt will burn as hot as the flames every time they touch it.)
- to disable the key (maybe smashing the key after it has been in the fire, while saying something like this will only work for the rightful owner) 
- and finally something to bind them from stealing again. I don't know who this person is, if it is one person or a group of people working together (there were several items stolen from other people in the area), so I don't know if it would be suitable for a spell where I'd normally write someone's name on a piece of paper. I thought about making a genderless clay figurine, and touching it's hands to all the surfaces this person would have had to have touched, and then tying their hands behind their back, while saying something about hands that were not welcome will be bound or something like that, and then freezing the figure (or burning it as well, to symbolise their conscience burning them too bad to steal again) 

Clearly, I need help with the wording of things. I also am drawn to color and candle magic, so whatever color associations you feel would be appropriate here would be helpful.

Make a Mint Money Charm and Human Sacrifice?,26,i45bdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i45bdp/make_a_mint_money_charm_and_human_sacrifice/,0,1596662808.0,"Whilst creating my August Witchcraft and Make a Mint Money Charm on youtube,  I was researching the Wicker Man traditions that occur primarily in August in the UK.  

It is such a fascinating subject that i thought I would give you a little synopsis...

Wicker Man festivals have been given a bad rap by a) Julius Ceasar and b) The 1970s horror film of the same name. And I wanted to redress the balance somewhat by sharing my thoughts here. 

A wicker man was created by bending green willow branches into the shape of a man.  The shaping of willow into various forms is a well known tradition of the UK and is especially prevalent in the South West of the country (the Somerset levels is where willow grows abundantly).  All sorts of creations are made from dragons to chickens.

There is scant evidence of human sacrifice performed by druids and witches within a wicker man.  The main proposer of this method was Julius Caesar himself whilst writiing about his conquest of Gaul (remember your Asterix?) He wanted to discredit the ‚Äòpriests‚Äô (i.e. the druids) of Gaul so there was good reason for him to say they sacrificed humans.

It was most likely that the sacrifice was the wicker man itself (the use of the word man fuelling the rumours of human sacrifice), sometimes they would contain dead animals who would then be cooked in the flames and eaten at the feast afterwards.  Their blood having been spilt and poured in libation before they were placed inside.  

Human sacrifice does not appear to be part of the Druidic rituals, although we cannot say for sure either way, as it was an oral tradition, but there does not appear to be an echo in todays practices and country traditions - which is something that you would expect from such a main stream religion of old.  There are certainly other echoes (maypole dancing for example).  Do check out my video on YT for more information at: [https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8](https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8) Which has the added bonus of a Make a Mint Money Charm (get some quick cash)

That is not to say that there were not sects who did sacrifice their fellow man - but it is unlikely that this was main stream (I mean would you follow such a sect where the next victim might be you?).",spells

So far, all I can think of in my limited experience is to carve my name into the candle and burn it (can't decide if over some days or all at once) during the waxing phase (the growing moon symbolic for growing allure) whilst meditating on my intent and visualizing my ideal self. Perhaps I could write a standard petition and place it under the candle as well.

Litha sun energy talisman,17,hctr9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hctr9r/litha_sun_energy_talisman/,0,1592715881.0,"Today I celebrated my first Litha as officially pagan. I wanted to make or do something special and decided I wanted to make my self a talisman to contain solar energy. Sharing is caring so I thought I'd post what I did here incase anyone finds it useful.

For background, I have depression & anxiety. I find it gets worse in the winter due to the lack of sunlight. My intent for this talisman was to capture or soak up the midsummer solar energy into an object that I can then tap into in the darker months if I find I'm struggling.

I used a bipoint sunstone crystal with one end larger than the other, orange jewelry wire and some wax. I left the sunstone and wire out from just after dawn until sunset in full sunlight to soak up as much energy as possible. 

At sunset, I lit a candle and incense and used the wire to fashion a net or cage tight around the crystal to contain and support it. I started at the bottom, ensuring the lower, larger point was accessible and wove up to the thinner point. Whilst I did this I meditated and visualised solar energy as a golden, glowing liquid flowing into the top of the crystal like water into a vase. Once I visualised it as full, I mentally and physically sealed it by winding the wire into a clasp (so I can hang it round my neck if needed) and placed hot wax from the candle around the top of the crystal and cage. I then keep it in my hands until my incense stopped burning and said ""So mote it be.""

I'm really pleased with how it came out. It's currently sitting on my altar for inspection by the ethereal beings that visit and then I will seal it away safely until winter. I plan to access the energy by pressing the base point against my skin and meditating on it.",spells

I want a job where I can write, do outreach and uplift my community. I want to make wonderful friends. I want a compassionate and kind romantic partner. & I really really want to be HAPPY more often than not.

Curious as I am I texted with this person who means that if he get a picture of me, a specific person and our names he will be able to make that specific person to love me.

First of all, this is nothing I plan to do. In fact even if I knew it was possible I would not do it because it's not ethical and I would not like to be with someone I knew was forced to love me. Also I suppose these kind of things will bite you in your ass one way or another.

But out of curiousity, are these things really possible? This guy even told me that I can pay after I see the result, which I found really really strange.",spells
Spell to lift a possible curse from old boss that gaslit and sexually harassed me?,29,g1ldjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/g1ldjf/spell_to_lift_a_possible_curse_from_old_boss_that/,7,1586955593.0,"I have a suspicion that an old manager cursed me at some point within the last year and a half. While I‚Äôve been battling with depression for years, I feel like it‚Äôs gotten worse, and aggravated Even more so by a streak of life altering bad luck. This woman talked about using chaos bb magic and working with Hecate before, and actively bragging about cursing people (I‚Äôm sure she has some hellish karma), and I don‚Äôt trust her, for this reason and that she tried to take advantage of me while I was her intern. When  told her managers what happened, she immediately got fired.
I‚Äôve looked at some spells already but if I actually have been cursed for 2 years, I would prefer to get guidance from those that are much more experienced.

I‚Äôm a beginner, but I‚Äôve been suspicious for a while. If anyone could help suggest some deep cleansing spells for curses, and hopefully spells for clearing my own energy and clarity on my path, it would mean the world. I know the second is a big ask but I‚Äôm honestly also scared that I‚Äôve let negativity fester in me so long that now I‚Äôm this mass of toxic energy?
I have nothing but time in my hands so happy to do long term spells, I just may have to utilize alternative materials since money is tight. 

Thank you all in advance!!",spells
