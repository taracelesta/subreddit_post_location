Practical Magic Inspired Spell to Find True Love?,1,jdx2ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/jdx2ie/practical_magic_inspired_spell_to_find_true_love/,3,1603120264.0,Hello! I watched Practical Magic this weekend and there is a part where we see someone casting a spell to find their true love. She is seen putting different herbs and flowers into a bowl and as she puts different things in she says a trait she would like her true love to have. She then holds the bowl up into the air underneath the moonlight and lets the wind blow away all of the contents in the bowl. I am wondering if there is actually a spell like this out there I could cast? I think it would be so much fun to try! Thanks!,Spells

So I’m still a beginner witch but so far things/ spells have been going well for me (small things like finding lost keys or getting a good score on my eval at work). So I realize this may be a bit too ambitious but my father currently works four hours away from home so he’s only with us on weekends; is there any sort of spell that can get him a job closer to home? Of course I understand he still has to work towards it and apply for jobs but is there a way to bring him some luck so he can get a job closer to us? We miss him so and his mental health has deteriorated since he’s left, I just want him to be okay again. Sorry for rambling, but I’m willing to try anything.

So basically I received a necklace years ago with a little jar filled with little black stones and such... the person just gave it to me (saying she felt I needed it) and said it would protect me

But anyway I kept this “spell jar necklace “ in my car in a little box (like a earring or necklace box from a jewelry store) for the past 10/12 years ...
Well I went to clean out my car today and it was completely shattered ....
I have no clue if this means anything.

Broomstick Spell,23,jbs5gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/jbs5gs/broomstick_spell/,1,1602811868.0,"So many witch hunters claimed that women rubbed their broomsticks with ergot and then used them on their feminine parts, showing the evil inherent in women for being overly sexual and ‘flying’. The broomstick really should be a symbol of revolt by witches and warlocks alike.

I have faced so much criticism, cynicism, and general abuse for being a witch. When at its worst I can think that we are no better off than during the witch hunts of old.

The main complaint that I get is that I am using stupid gullible people (to what end hasn’t been explained to me yet) and that it is against God’s Law (whatever THAT is)

So in order to con the gullible (if you consider yourselves to be so?) and go against God’s (undefined) law, I made a samhain video about broomsticks, their folk lore and how to use them. Many witches have asked me this as Sweeping Magic is great for many many different uses and my latest offering tries to address the rituals and rites you would use a broomstick for....... as well as can you fly on them...........!

Are there spells to implant ideas into someone's head? And would this go against free will?,5,j9u84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j9u84k/are_there_spells_to_implant_ideas_into_someones/,3,1602549265.0,"I'm still a little witchling, I'm sorry.

Here is my situation: My family is looking for a new home as the house we rent is being sold. My great grandmother is 91 and still lives alone but relies heavily in my grandparents who live a few minutes from her. They are very charitable people with a large home and have taken her in during rough times in the past. I would assume she will be living with them permanently in the near future. 

If my great grandmother was to leave her home, it would likely remain empty as my aunts and uncles own their own homes ans my cousins are in college. Renting to my family would be an ideal situation in my mind. A stable/ permanent home for us, extra income for my grandparents/great grandmother, a great school system for my kids(the schools in her town are better than the ones in mine), keep the house in the family, put us closer to my extended family-which would allowe to help take care of my great grandmother and for my kids to spend more time with her while she is still here. 

I don't have the courage to bring up this idea with my grandparents or great grandmother. They have helped us out a LOT in the past and it would just feel wrong to ask them for more. But if they were to present the idea, I'd enthusiastically agree. I've been manifesting, I just want to do more.

In search of powerful love spells that have worked before,1,j8tazf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j8tazf/in_search_of_powerful_love_spells_that_have/,9,1602396173.0,"First of all, hi. I've had a break up in July of this year (2020) and ever since it I've been devastated. Our relationship was everything for me, and I truly felt a incredibly deep connection with her, like she was my soulmate. Some might not believe me on this, but I also didn't until we met. It was, or at least felt, like a perfect relationship with the right person. But well, she broke up with me.

I would have been much worse if it wasn't for a friend of mine that taught me sigil magic and how to make a servitor. This servitor I made currently works (mostly) at night, when the mind is more influentiable and dark/black magic is stronger, and it makes her love me more than she already does.

However, as the days passes I start to become insecure, afraid or anxious with the lack of results or progress. I don't doubt it can work, but because it can only influence her (can't overcome her free will) I feel like it will take too long for me. I have self-control, but to use a servitor for months without seeing progress doesn't feel different from white magic or prayers.

I come here in search of a powerful love spell that has worked before and will bring her back to me in a short time. My biggest concern is that she won't come back to me by free will, so I would like to know spells that are above it. I will deal with whatever consequences that come with them afterwards, so don't expect me to change my mind about doing it by telling me the consequences beforehand.

And before you come to me to talk about your spellcaster services for a small price or a big price that 100% works and is totally not a scam, I'm not paying you. I don't have a international credit card and I highly doubt you can offer me what I want in a price I can afford.",Spells

Thought I'd share a spell which I performed last new moon which has been working really well for me. It can also be performed on a Wednesday (Mercury - Commerce) during a waxing moon (growth period).

Ingredients: 1 Charcoal Disk in a fireproof dish & Benzoin resin granules / Matches / Chopped Basil (dried or fresh) / 1 green candle (I'd recommend no less than 6hr burn time) / 1 yellow candle / 1 Small broom or hand brush / Large bunch fresh Rosemary / 2 yards twine or string / 30cm string of dried juniper berries / 6 drops of mint essential oil

Casting the Spell:

1. Cast the circle (search the sub if you are not sure how, there will be other instructions for how to open / close a circle)
2. Light the charcoal disk and sprinkle on the Benzoin & Basil
3. Light the green candle and say ""Earth, witness this spell"". Light the yellow candle and say ""Air, carry it well""
4. Tie the Rosemary around the handle of the brush, then wrap the twine around until it is completely used, chanting as you do: ""Born of earth, carried in air, increase worth, away with care"". Fasten it off then tie the string of berries around the twine.
5. Anoint the handle & brush with the Mint oil. Pass the brush over the incense smoke 3 times, saying ""Once I invest thee, Twice I impress thee, Thrice I then bless thee"". Leave the brush with the candles until they burn out.
6. Keep the brush over the doorway of your business (I work from home so keep mine over my front door)

Hope this is useful for someone. Let me know if you have any q's. The spell is taken from the book 'The Spells Bible' by Ann-Marie Gallagher.

I’m kind of stuck between banishing, a break-up spell, or maybe something else, or if I should try to use both. He’s not only aggressive and verbally abusive to me, but to the rest of my family including my mother, there has been times he’s been physical too. He’s always nasty, just the other day I overheard my tired mother trying to rest and him requesting for help with her responding she’s tired and just laid down and his snappy response is “I don’t give a f***, come help me now” and he is always like this. For someone as kind as me I can’t tell you how many times I’ve almost snapped but it’s only my fear of him and making things worse holding me back, his behavior is unforgivable. Trying to talk back to him is like pouring gasoline over fire. 

My mother also never voices against him anymore. As far as things such as break-up spells, I can tell you I’d never want to do something like that without good intention, so I’d never attempt to force two apart out of jealously or anything. My mother deserves to be treated right, as well as the rest of my family, and me and my sister are constantly afraid of being around him. I think it’s for the best that he leaves us, I definitely do not think they are meant to be or that myself and the rest of my family are destined to be emotionally scarred the rest of our lives. 

I’ve always been a firm believer in magic, but I’m inexperienced with attempting to use it myself. So I was wondering if anyone might have experience with a situation like this, or knows any spells that might help, or if anyone knows anyone I could go to for getting help. I also don’t want to hurt my mother as I know some break-up spells can be rather nasty for both sides. 
I’ve been thinking to start with a break-up spell, then a banishment with the intention of breaking them apart and for him to leave us alone, but any tips are definitely appreciated :)",Spells

Are call me spells dangerous?,2,j2nbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2nbev/are_call_me_spells_dangerous/,1,1601505425.0,"I did a freezer spell first just to stop thinking about this person and keep him from pooping back up and it seemed to work and then I wanted to connect with him again because I still have feelings for him. He was just a nice person. He was never mean to me I just knew that it would t have worked cause we both have partners and I have a child. 

I used a call me spell awhile back and it worked within a month. He added me back on Facebook and we talked just a few times. But I know deep down inside it’s wrong cause he’s now married and I’m doing it for selfish reasons. I just miss talking to him. I don’t really want to break up his marriage I just want to talk to him as a friend where it’s not awkward and we can just talk like normal people. But I know that wouldn’t happen cause he and I both know the feelings are still there. He’s moved on and so have I but when we see each others name pop up the memories come back. Which is what I miss about it. Just talking about the old days and how close we were. 

Because I was “being selfish” knowing that I’m messing with his free will, could I be conjuring up so bad luck? I’ve done it twice in a short time frame and it works but it’s not a love spell where I want him to fall back in love with me it’s just a contact spell. I guess you can say I was manlipulating the situation. But my intent isn’t to break them up. I just miss talking to him. 

Has bad luck ever happened to anyone? Maybe it’s a coincidence.. nothing bad has really happened to myself except I’ve been feeling more emotional and my anxiety is extremely bad and I’ve been more angry with my relationship. Nothing physical to myself or my family has happened. I just want to see others experience.",Spells

Manifesting With The Moon,29,j2fu9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j2fu9h/manifesting_with_the_moon/,0,1601470846.0,"# Only approximately 239,00 miles away from the Earth, there is no doubt that the extraordinary, celestial mass in our night sky-- The Moon-- has powerful control over the Earth and its people. 

While the Sun represents masculine energy, the Moon represents the utmost powerful feminine energy. She signifies intuition, birth, death, and reincarnation and represents our hidden emotions, desires, worries, and self-work.

Spiritually, she acts as our Mama, subtly reminding her children that everything on Earth is ever-changing and follows a natural cycle. She offers us the ability to feel, nourish, learn from the past, and creatively unlock and express our authentic selves.

THE NEW MOON

The New Moon is the first phase in the Lunar cycle. It occurs when The Moon comes into direct alignment in the Sun. When the Sun becomes possessive of the Moon and he does not want to share her beauty with the Earth, we are shown emptiness representing a time for fresh starts and new beginnings. It’s time to rest and begin planting new seeds of desire and intention by writing them down. This is the time to meditate and gently breathe new life into any areas of stagnation in which you wish to thrive.

THE FULL MOON

The Full Moon follows the Waxing Gibbous. The Sun and the Moon are in harmony and the Sun reflects his brilliance off the Moon’s surface, creating her own light for us to use. This phase represents intense thoughts and powerful breakthroughs. Full moons are thought to influence humans so powerfully, there is a record of heightened emotions and even psychosis. This is the time to reflect. Allow yourself to analyze what’s working for you--or what’s not. Celebrate this realization-- this is the universe connecting with you.

Some simple spells that I use on an almost daily basis:,71,j1do05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/j1do05/some_simple_spells_that_i_use_on_an_almost_daily/,8,1601334300.0,"So I thought I'd share a few of the simple spells I use on an almost daily basis.

&#x200B;

To make the work day go faster (try not to look at the clock too often after saying it and for an extra boost, repeat to yourself or out loud several times throughout the day 'I can't believe how fast the day's going' or 'wow. It's already lunchtime or whatever time'):

'Time flies when you're having fun.

But that is not now, so let it be done.

Let the time fly by so fast.

So that this work day will not last.'

&#x200B;

When I'm trying to do something creative and the Muse just won't flow:

'Muse of art, Muse of sound, Muse of thought gather round.

Come to me with your guiding light. Guide my hand in this creative rite.

And as I call your spirits forth, so shall it be.'

&#x200B;

When I need to focus OR could use a little boost of luck (works for both...just got to set the intention):

'Right time, right place

Sacred moment, sacred space

From sky above to earth below

I am in my perfect flow.'

&#x200B;

And finally, the most simple:

Simply repeat to yourself several time throughout the day:

 'Everything works out in my favor.'

I recently went to a metaphysical store to purchase some more crystals and Sage, while there I saw what I thought was a necklace with an amethyst stone and was drawn to it so I asked the cashier for it and she told me it was a pendulum then asked if I ever had one which I didn’t so she explained a little about it to me. Anyway I purchased my products got home and immediately watch one YouTube video on pendulums the video I watched the lady said to ask the pendulum questions or tell the pendulum things that u know the answer to in order to establish which way is yes or no so that’s what I did. The first thing I said to the pendulum was “my name is” and I gave my real name and the pendulum moved forward and back. Then I said “I have 4 daughters” which is true, and again the pendulum moved back and forth so I took back and forth to my mean yes. Then I said “I have one son,” (which I don’t, I only have 4 daughters) and the pendulum moved side to side, then I said “I’m an only child” and the pendulum moved side to side I’m actually the youngest of 5, so I took side to side to mean No. Now here’s why I’m confused. As I said this is my first pendulum so I’ve been watching videos on it trying to learn more about it. But the more videos I watch people are saying to the pendulum “show me yes, show me no, maybe etc,” they’re not asking the pendulum questions or telling the pendulum things so that pendulum can show which way is yes or no. So thinking I already knew my pendulum yes and No answer I foolishly decided to test it out and asked it to show me yes please and it spun clockwise instead of back and forth, then I asked show me No and it went back and forth instead of side to side so now I’m not sure what yes and no really is with my pendulum. Did I mess it up by doing this, and do I need to do anything so that I can be sure of the answers instead of feeling unsure now?",Spells

What does this mean,1,iw5nel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iw5nel/what_does_this_mean/,3,1600597529.0,"I did a breakup friendship spell on my ex and a female friend of his using candle magick. I did this spell because he has a few female friends which doesn't bother me since he knew them before meeting me. However with this particular female friend whenever he communicates with her the energy and vibe between us become different and conflict comes between us, I asked him if he has any feelings for her and he said No but admitted to me that she came onto him which is why I broke it off with him because he picked her up while she was in town and hungout with her and told me after the fact. To me she's a thorn between us and I am hoping he and I reconcile but I want her removed from his life.

So I found a spell online and tweaked it a little changing some of the words to fit what I wanted. As I was saying the spell his candle started normal size and was stabled however the candle for her sparked, and when I finished saying the spell I put the candles away from each other as instructed and let it burn. While it was burning both candles were the same color which was blue and gold but his more blue than hers, hers was more golden than blue. The flame for his candle started to get really low to the point I thought it would go out but it didn't and remained steady; however the flame for her candle was tall and unsteady, it blew, it danced, it sparked and popped and the more it did this the lower his flame got. But then his flame started to get taller, and brighter while remaining steady and her flame while still popping, dancing, blowing, and sparking started getting lower and calm down becoming steady. It got a little lower than his but not low enough to blow out. Eventually I fell asleep, but when I woke up the candle for her was nearly gone and the flame was out, but the candle for him was low but the flame was still there and remained there until I blew it out.  Can someone please tell me what this means, is this a good sign, a bad sign or what?

Intrusive or negative thoughts?,9,ivzbm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ivzbm4/intrusive_or_negative_thoughts/,10,1600573289.0,"Sometimes there are things that I think of that show up in my head that eventually end up doing more damage to not only myself but my relationship with a close friend of mine. Things like allowing a certain worry to build up inside of me until I feel I have no choice to speak to my friend about it, only for them to end up getting upset at me because of it.

Which in turn just gives rise to a new worry and concern of mine, will then go through the same cycle, getting myself worried to the point that said topic comes up in conversation and then end up harming the relationship further.

The worry I am experiencing is that we had an incident some three weeks ago. It took awhile to get them speaking to me again, though it is in a public discord and not a private chat like we usually are. I guess it is because they don't trust me enough to speak to me in a private setting at the moment.

There is a worry that things won't return to the way they were before the argument, combined with trying to be patient enough that things recover over time in their own right, and if they are still upset with me. (Which if they were upset with me, why speak to me and include me in playing Among Us for a full night, or allowing me to be on her telegram and discord?)

To compound the fact, their father and step mom got diagnosed with Covid. And I am struggling on exactly how to help them as they had asked to not be flooded with DM's at the time, as they are still struggling to process it; plus the trouble of distance.

***TLDR***; I don't want to allow this mixture of worry to overcome me. I want to do a spell to protect me from this worry, and rebuild my friends trust in me by showing them I respect and listen to their requests.",Spells

I’m hoping someone can help. Every night for the past few weeks I have woken up exactly at 3am on the dot or 3:01. I almost always wake up from a nightmare or wake up scared. It feels like there is a darkness around me or something watching me. Essentially I don’t feel safe. If I have to leave my room I feel incredibly exposed and like something is breathing down my neck. Sometimes I’m able to fall back asleep and sometimes not. I’m just not sure what to do anymore. I’m afraid to interact with whatever may be in my home because it doesn’t feel like anything I want to invite to engage with me further. Please any advice would be appreciated.,Spells

Honey Jar and Sour Jar simultaneously?,15,iswinv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iswinv/honey_jar_and_sour_jar_simultaneously/,15,1600153913.0,"Hi Witches!✨

Long short story, a month and something ago, I learnt that my LTR boyfriend cheated on me at the beginning of the year. ""Managed"" to get over his shit show until he let himself fall in love with a coworker and out of love with me because of his lies. I was ready to get over all of it, but a couple of days later he decided it was better for him and I to part ways (heroic right...). 2 weeks later he was with her after swearing he wasn’t leaving me for her.

Fast forward to now: I sadly still love him, but, I doubt it could be salvageable now that she is sleeping next to him and I am not sure I could get over that if he came back to me.

Still, I made two jars, a Honey directed to us and a sour to them. I am wondering if it is possible to manage both at the same time since he his on both spells?

If that’s any help, here’s what I used

The sour is: Vinegar, Chili flakes, mustard seeds, dog’s and cat’s hair, wild roses thorns, a pic of him, a printed pic of her and an item from him

The sweet is : Cinnamon, Honey, Vanilla beans, rose petal, wild roses leaves, bay leaves, lavender oil, dried flowers from a bouquet he gave me some years ago and an item of his.

In the end if we are not made to eachothers, I deeply wish his new found ""true love"" will wreck him in every ways for what I have been through because of his actions.",Spells

Blood Magick for Healing Spell?,14,iscgpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iscgpr/blood_magick_for_healing_spell/,5,1600080405.0,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going to make this as brief as I can. My partner was recently diagnosed with having UVH (Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction). It's a bit rare compared to BVH, and we're pretty young. To break it down, UVH is when one ear stops communicating proper signals to the brain, which then compromises one's sense of balance. It basically feels like you're drunk all the time, but without any of the good feelings from it. At least that's how my partner puts it. It might be permanent, but it might go away on its own within several weeks. Currently what we're able to do is some physical therapy exercises to retrain the nerve to properly communicate with his brain.

However, I've been thinking about working a spell for my partner that may help the healing process, even if I can reduce the dizziness for him too. And that's why I wanted to know if its a good idea to use blood magick (a prick of the finger really) to amplify the healing spell. I will more than likely get a strand or two of his hair as well to make the spell as specific for him as I possibly can. 

I've never included blood magick in my spells before, because I know it's very powerful. I don't include certain things in my energy work unless I know I've done my research for it.

Thoughts? Have any of you ever done blood magick to help amplify a healing spell? How'd it turn out? I'd really appreciate some stories. Thanks in advance!",Spells

Right now he's dealing with the typical baby mama drama. She is very abusive to him, long story short they broke up he is willing to give her literally everything (even the house that he bought, he is giving her half the profit when they resell, like 30k) the only thing he wants in return is half custody of the baby. 
She's just going above and beyond telling lies talking about how he is it drunk and he can't be trusted with the baby, and she is in fear for her and her baby's life when they're around him and my family. (I have a big family and we have done nothing but accepted her and her family with love and open arms) Her mother and her family as well, starting all sorts of drama spreading lies etc. All these people are drug addicts, and associated with scary people that can put the baby in harm's way no questions asked. Granite my brother is no angel but he is not an abusive person and he is a wonderful father, he works his buns off, does whatever he can to make sure her and the baby are taken care of and then some. 
He's not a drunk, partying is last thing on his mind cuz all he cares about is coming home to his daughter like that is all he has to live for kind of a thing. I don't know, she doesn't care about what's fair for the baby she only cares about getting what she wants. I don't do magic that puts harm on other people, and I don't intend to. So I was wondering if anybody had something out there or some advice on stopping the lies and the gossip and  just overall do what's in the best favor for the child, because she is the most important. They are both great parents, they just weren't a good match for each other and the baby shouldn't have to suffer for that. 
They have a court case coming up for custody and all that, I just want her lies to be revealed in abundance so it doesn't affect the custody case. My brother has a very successful business and I feel like that's why she doesn't want him to have any custody so she could take full advantage of child support etc. It's very selfish and just disturbing. I have been surrounding her and her family with white light and just trying real hard to pull them out of that negative energy just black smoke that they're surrounding themselves with. I constantly put protection around my brother and have done much magic to help with his court cases etc. But I truly feel like I need to do something more, and it's also in a bit of short notice like everything's happening so fast.

I am very determined to be with my ex again, but recent social media activity (not his, that of a girl I suspect he is seeing yet cannot verify) has dented my confidence. I missed a chance to have someone cast a reconciliation spell for me tonight, and will have to wait till the end of September for the next opportunity. 

I am using a large mojo bag, which is placed on a high shelf at home. I have been taught to look in its direction and focus my wishes on it as I do. However, I find myself feeling nervous as I repeat in my mind affirmative statements about him and I.

I will also be casting a candle spell on Wednesday. The candle is said to burn for about 6 hours, and I have been told to focus all my wishing energy on it throughout the process. 

I really want this to work, and to learn some tips on being confident about a future outcome, so any advice would be very much appreciated.

Is it possible/safe to enchant an object that may already be enchanted?,16,ijiocb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ijiocb/is_it_possiblesafe_to_enchant_an_object_that_may/,4,1598844168.0,"My boyfriend has a lot of issues with mental health and self worth, so among other things I want to enchant something to help him improve. I'm not super experienced with magic but I find it works like a charm (pun unintended) when I use it in tandem with non-magical solutions. So the logical choice for enchanting would be his favorite necklace, which belonged to a close friend that passed away a few years ago. But she was a green witch, and this pendant looks like it was a sigil she might have made herself. I never got to meet her myself, but I asked if he thought enchanting it to help him would be something she would have wanted and he said yes. 

If more info on the possible purpose helps, the origins of the necklace is completely unknown, but if it had a spell my guess is it would be gardening or health based. Her health was always poor, doctors couldn't answer many of them. My boyfriend is the same way, and about once every couple years he suddenly gets hit with a new rare and disorder, but last year it was pretty tame by his standards. (Two episodes of stress induced paralysis. This is what he considers tame.) So if the sigil was health based there would be evidence to back it up, but if it's gardening based he probably overpowers it with his genuinely unnatural ability to kill any plant he touches.

So if this necklace had spells on it already, would there be any harm in another? Would having the second spell align with the original's intentions help? Thanks in advance!",Spells
Trying remember a spell,10,ij9let,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ij9let/trying_remember_a_spell/,0,1598805554.0,"Okay so a couple of years ago I found this spell online and recently remembered about it and want to try to find it so if it sounds familiar or anyone knows please let me know.

I managed to stumble onto this website on accident. I remember it had a black background and red letters however this website was more for  black magic spells. 

I believe it was a spell to give bad dreams for 3 days... 
All the materials required for this spell was a piece of string.
You are meant to tie this string 3 times, and with each knot you were supposed to recite some spell.
It’s supposed to give the person of choice or who you hate terrible nightmares about the thing they fear most

Banishment help/tips,1,ij4oer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ij4oer/banishment_helptips/,1,1598781270.0,"Hi, I have a question about banishing someone in my life. The situation is a bit complicated to type out completely but the gist of it is my stepdad is a very toxic and controlling person, I think he is manipulative as well. He’s also verbally abusive and in some cases physical, but because my mother is still engaged to him (I believe once maybe 3 years ago she might have intended to break it off after an incident where he threatened to kill our cat at the time, had my sister start burying a hole and pushed her into a ground and had us in the car that night, unfortunately he somehow convinced her to stay)

 I find it tricky to get involved with child protective services or something similar, because he’d figure it out and it would turn nasty (my mother also overheard my sister mentioning it once and brought it up to him and it ended with him screaming a lot and saying things like ‘if you think this is abuse then I will show you what abuse feels like’) 

Since the cat incident she also hasn’t gone against him much (such as walking away or yelling at him for something) and it seems whenever he does something she disagrees with she hardly ever says anything now and kind of laughs it off, and me and my sister are the most intimidated and feel unsafe, it’s been about five years and I really can’t stand his presence anymore and just want our family to be happy without him. I’ve already consulted a kind root worker who’s already casted a banishment spell for me and gave them all the details I could, but I just wanted to know if there is anything more I could do say in the case the spell ended up not working, or even just added boosters. 

As much as I hate him, I don’t wish to harm him, so I’m not looking for anything that would cause curses or something to potentially harm someone in my family. 
I’ve heard a bit of cayenne pepper and sage being being mixed counter clockwise in your hand and blowing it is one method, I also have a poppet. 
I’ve heard of black salt being used for banishment as well, but I’m having a little trouble finding out exactly what you’re supposed to do with it/how you can use it for banishment. 
But any tips in general would be really helpful. I’m inexperienced with the subject so if there is small things I can do, I would prefer that or a ‘beginner’ level sort of work. I just really need help to get him out our life. 

Also, I’ve considered my mother’s feelings before, but from what I’ve experienced over these years I believe there is much more better for her, and she definitely deserves someone who isn’t so hateful, he’s been nasty and aggressive to her as well. I think she feels too intimidated to be able to really stand up to him, and she hasn’t in a while and always seems to give in or side with him even if she doesn’t want to. I just really want him to be out our life without having to feel scared of him when he’s around every day.",Spells

Saturday Spell Challenge: self love spell using only one tool,34,iepnbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iepnbp/saturday_spell_challenge_self_love_spell_using/,5,1598156298.0,"We so often have questions about what ingredients to buy, tools to use, etc when it comes to spell casting, but it’s good to remember that you have everything you really need to get started already!

For this spell challenge: create &amp; share a spell for self-love and acceptance using only one magical tool (or no tools!)

For mine:

Start by taking a shower or bath to refresh &amp; renew, meditate &amp; visualize on the water cleansing you physically, and also removing any “outer rind” built up on your mind/psyche.  Maybe you’ve been having to toughen up lately, to push through fatigue at work, or have been self-medicating.  Let the water rinse away the tough outer shell you have built through these survival mechanisms.  Let the water leave you bare, naked and vulnerable, cleansed of facade and receptive to change.

Dry off, but don’t apply any moisturizers/creams/after shower routine.  Find a nice place to be alone with a mirror, behind closed doors (full length mirror is best).  Dim the lights and work by candlelight if that best sets the tone.

Cast a circle/sacred space/raise energy in the way that fits your tradition, but without using tools — only your body, your mind, and your spiritual connections.

If you work with divine feminine or nurturing spirits, call on them at this time to work through you.

Place an oil, salve or cream that you use in your magical practice (the one tool) on the palms of your hands, rub them together slowly and open up the channel between you and your concept of the divine/spiritual mother.  Continue to work your hands until your hands are her hands and no longer your own.

Disrobe infront of the mirror, and have the courage to not look away.  Confront the parts of your body that unsettle you, scare you, or make you feel ashamed.  For each part, think about:

1) What is the nature of this feeling?

2) What are the thoughts that lead to it?

3) What external places do these thoughts come from?  Media, judgmental family members, societal norms or pressures?

Remember: your hands are now HER hands.  She is with you.  Use your hands to comfort you in the way a mother would.  If things get too intense, turn away from the mirror and re-center your mind on her presence before returning to the mirror. 

On the part of your body that you are focusing on, rub the oil into your skin, with gentle and loving motions like a mother figure would.  Call upon your nurturing spirits or divine feminine to act through your hands to bless this part of you and to remind you that it is holy, beautiful and powerful.  Trace your sacred symbols with your hands over this part, taking your time.

Apply more oil to the rest of your skin, like you would a moisturizer.  Replace the space left behind by removing your hard outer shell with the oil/salve as a renewing and protecting layer of the divine feminine.  Take a long time with this, giving extra attention where needed.

Conclude by paying extra attention on the area of your chest/heart (or where you feel the most tension).

Now, place your body in the positions of any divine poses you know, such as those depicted in statues of your tradition.  If you don’t know any, ask the divine feminine you work with to teach one to you, or create a pose that represents beauty, power, magic or motherhood.  In the mirror, realize the beauty that you have created with your own body.

At this time, do what you feel most compelled to — close the circle, thank your spirits, journal about the experience, divine, craft, meditate more deeply on the thoughts/feelings that arose, do something that makes you feel powerful, sleep, have an ugly cry, watch the AOC makeup video — all are valid!

Over the next few days, take some time to research depictions &amp; descriptions of divine, spiritual, mythological women through history and across cultures, such as:

Creepy stuff appearing,4,ienjy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ienjy0/creepy_stuff_appearing/,4,1598149309.0,"every time I turn around and just normally I see things. There are a few “creatures” that appear regularly One is a nearly fully clothed in black fabric that looks like bandages with three fingered hands that looks either burned or severely cut. The face is carved out, with dried blood seen and the cloth covering the top of its head. It has on three occasions rotated it’s head so it’s chin is facing the sky and I see him under beds and through the edges of doors. He is also maybe 4’9 although I’ve seen him as tall as my door maybe 6’0 and his elbows are like knees and he scuttles all over my walls he appears the second most

There is one with a yellow cardigan, maybe 7’0, wearing what I think is blue jeans and a bowl hair cut, I only see blues as he runs past or as I turn I think he has a partially wrinkly face, maybe 50 and a massive smile yet I know his hair is strictly black, I often see him whilst in cars or other transport. He is there pretty much every car drive and occasionally walking a shaggy dog


There is also a 5’5 ish woman in a flowery bride dress with her veil thingy torn. She has stark blue eyes and jet black hair. She has one of those really strong jaw lines. Sometimes I see her but her face and hands are withered and grey and her eyes look like the ones blind people have. She always appears in mirrors late at night in the dark. She is in mirrors and other reflective surfaces.


And there is also a man with a sort of Indiana Jones hat, long sleeves of what I assume is a suit and smart trousers and black shoes. It’s hard to make him out because he is totally black, he is opaque and black everywhere, like the void. He is maybe a little shorter than the woman. He can also be in other shapes, like a fat man, and I giant hairy thing with massive arms. He always appears at night, seen through pretty much everywhere the other spooky things have been mentioned, the corner of my eye, door cracks mirrors and once lying on the bed next to me, looking right at me, to which I promptly turned the lights on and he disappeard. He has twice shown his only non black feature, his teeth. Once through a door crack looking at me sideways with his mouth smiling with literal sharpened triangle teeth with his mouth stretched too wide, the second time when he was lying next to me.
I see him a lot
He is pure evil to the core and I just can’t shake the feeling he is always watching, waiting for be to let my guard down. Something about him just seems purely demonic in every way I can think of. I have terrible nightmares about him where whenever i speak or ask anything or even move towards him he opens his mouth, revealing fire inside of him. I don’t know if he is laughing, taunting or just explaining he wants to watch the world burn. 

There are many other dark things I have no physical image of but I feel them there.


If anyone can identify what these are or interpret them please go ahead, there are many  more things I hear, sense or smell and I feel like there is always something after me",Spells
I think I accidentally tied my energy with someone!,7,iegclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/iegclf/i_think_i_accidentally_tied_my_energy_with_someone/,6,1598121897.0,"So I made a protection spell jar for a friend (let’s call her Carla) and I think I may have accidentally tied our energies together. 

So Carla and I have been friends for about a year. We were that ‘will they won’t they’ sapphic pair who are too awkward or scared to admit their feelings. We kinda started talking about dating but it eventually got nowhere and we had to walk away from whatever it was. 

Months later I made a protective spell jar on Carla’s request, and being a baby witch I just put in  additional components that I liked the meaning of without thinking it through. 

I added salt, eggshell,  basil, chamomile, tumeric and black pepper. I ALSO added red rosebuds and a forget-me-not. 

I also made an identical bottle for myself at the same time. 

Now, since seeing her in person since giving it to her, there is this massive energy between us. We keep being dragged to each other and every interaction feels like it carries more weight somehow.

I need help creating a Binding/Freezing spell for a thief who is planning on coming back to steal again.,8,idjg7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/idjg7x/i_need_help_creating_a_bindingfreezing_spell_for/,3,1597988142.0,"*edit* I am not interested in or able to pay someone to cast this spell for me. I am only looking for advice. 

This morning I woke up to find that my spare car key had been stolen. I don't want to go into details, but I think they are probably planning on coming back to steal my car, bc why else would they steal the keys? I have done all there is to do in the mundane, police are useless, as usual. 

In my head, I'm thinking of creating a three part spell/ritual,
- to make the key uncomfortable for them to touch (my initial thought is make a clay or wooden key and put in a fire, while chanting something like their guilt will burn as hot as the flames every time they touch it.)
- to disable the key (maybe smashing the key after it has been in the fire, while saying something like this will only work for the rightful owner) 
- and finally something to bind them from stealing again. I don't know who this person is, if it is one person or a group of people working together (there were several items stolen from other people in the area), so I don't know if it would be suitable for a spell where I'd normally write someone's name on a piece of paper. I thought about making a genderless clay figurine, and touching it's hands to all the surfaces this person would have had to have touched, and then tying their hands behind their back, while saying something about hands that were not welcome will be bound or something like that, and then freezing the figure (or burning it as well, to symbolise their conscience burning them too bad to steal again) 

Clearly, I need help with the wording of things. I also am drawn to color and candle magic, so whatever color associations you feel would be appropriate here would be helpful.

As the target is long distance and I communicate with them over the computer, there isn't much I can see, but they seem okay despite the situation that I am trying to get them out of.

It is such a fascinating subject that i thought I would give you a little synopsis...

Wicker Man festivals have been given a bad rap by a) Julius Ceasar and b) The 1970s horror film of the same name. And I wanted to redress the balance somewhat by sharing my thoughts here. 

A wicker man was created by bending green willow branches into the shape of a man.  The shaping of willow into various forms is a well known tradition of the UK and is especially prevalent in the South West of the country (the Somerset levels is where willow grows abundantly).  All sorts of creations are made from dragons to chickens.

There is scant evidence of human sacrifice performed by druids and witches within a wicker man.  The main proposer of this method was Julius Caesar himself whilst writiing about his conquest of Gaul (remember your Asterix?) He wanted to discredit the ‘priests’ (i.e. the druids) of Gaul so there was good reason for him to say they sacrificed humans.

It was most likely that the sacrifice was the wicker man itself (the use of the word man fuelling the rumours of human sacrifice), sometimes they would contain dead animals who would then be cooked in the flames and eaten at the feast afterwards.  Their blood having been spilt and poured in libation before they were placed inside.  

Human sacrifice does not appear to be part of the Druidic rituals, although we cannot say for sure either way, as it was an oral tradition, but there does not appear to be an echo in todays practices and country traditions - which is something that you would expect from such a main stream religion of old.  There are certainly other echoes (maypole dancing for example).  Do check out my video on YT for more information at: [https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8](https://youtu.be/NPpD-JJfaR8) Which has the added bonus of a Make a Mint Money Charm (get some quick cash)

That is not to say that there were not sects who did sacrifice their fellow man - but it is unlikely that this was main stream (I mean would you follow such a sect where the next victim might be you?).",Spells

Spooky Graveyard Dirt,12,i3pkau,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i3pkau/spooky_graveyard_dirt/,6,1596596951.0,"Question About Graveyard Dirt:

My friend brought me some graveyard dirt from Stull Cemetery recently. After doing some research on the place, in addition to the dark and foreboding energy I felt as soon as I touched it, I’ve decided that this soil is evil and I’m not sure what to do with it. She claimed that she had left the spirits as offering in exchange for the dirt but also says she has paid penance for taking it. And I’m really not trying to fuck with spirits like that. 
I never use magic to harm others, only to make my life easier and more interesting. So I can’t imagine using this soil on anyone in particular. But I’m not sure what to use it for. And I don’t want the spirits to escape it. Right now I have it bound by a sigil, hemp cord, and it is grounded by a large piece of hematite in a box with an eye on it. I’m considering sealing it in candle wax. I’m also seriously thinking about driving to Kansas just to return the dirt to where it belongs. 
What do you think? Could I use it for a magical purpose that will not cause harm or release evil entities? Should I seal it further, then use it for one spell in particular and then rid my hands of it? Or should I return it?",Spells

Influencing a change in my bosses mind for the better?,2,i310sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i310sf/influencing_a_change_in_my_bosses_mind_for_the/,1,1596503558.0,"Hi r/spells. I’m in a predicament at my workplace, and considering the “right” thing to do about this situation.

In a nutshell, my boss and president of the company I work for will not let anyone work from home full time, or at least temporarily, even during this Covid crisis. I’ve talked to him about this prior to the outbreak, and my only choices are : be furloughed and he looks for another person to fill my place, or work as a freelancer at reduced pay with no benefits and considered less of an asset. Not to mention I honestly thought working a few days a week full time from home would be a part of my job, and one of the reasons why I accepted it. This would benefit many people, not just me. 
My job is mostly done on the computer and very mentally taxing.
My company is a small company and considered essential. My boss is an older person and traditional in his thinking, and quite frankly behind the times when it comes to workflow. There will hopefully be a change in company ownership by the end of this year and considering who my superior is, my only hope is that maybe this will be possible after the change. 

This company is way out in the country, and the commute sometimes sucks. I’m not the only person who would rather not commute and some of these like-minded people are a part of the family owned business, but what my boss says always goes.

My problem is...how do I go about influencing this change that would help all of us? I’ve talked to him multiple times about it and it’s like beating a dead horse. I was given advice before the pandemic that it may be better to wait and ask him about working from home after the season’s big project is finished, but the pandemic changed the path of my prior plan. I’m stuck in this job because my family could really use the money and I’m lucky to have it because I’m entry level. This issue has been digging into me like a rusty nail and caused me great dislike for the workplace and my boss for some time, especially with the crisis. We all need a positive change.

I could really use some help with this.",Spells

An Alternative to Cursing?,14,i2nw3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/i2nw3m/an_alternative_to_cursing/,13,1596446298.0,"I found a curse that would bring the actions of someone back onto them threefold when they have hurt you, and I like the idea of helping someone to realize that they have caused so much pain to someone else, but I don't want to harm them.

I know that karma dictates that they will get what's coming to them, but is there something that could open their eyes, because in this specific instance, they refuse to acknowledge that what they did was completely wrong, cost me a lot of money and stress, and almost caused all of us to be homeless. 

(Long story short, they lied about getting jobs to pay rent and then waited the day rent was due to tell me and my other roommate, as we were going to talk to our landlords about the fact that the house all of us were living in was uninhabitable. They then blamed us, their parents, the landlords, the world being unfair, when they ultimately got evicted and me and my other roommate got out due to the uninhabitability. Yes that's the short of it, and doesn't include all of the emotional abuse and gaslighting they put me and my other roommate through.)

It just feels as if they will never know the full extent of the pain they caused when they refuse to even acknowledge that they dug their own graves and threw themselves in, and then wondered why they were in the hole and blamed it on everyone around them. I have tried to explain it to them, but they refuse to acknowledge it or own any of their part in it.

I dont want to curse them, so much as help open their eyes to the vast amount of hurt they have caused. Does anyone know a spell for this?

I used to live in texas and there was a dog that lived next to my boss/friends house.

I befriended the dog and the owners even let me take him home for sleepovers on freezing nights sometimes. I tried to buy the dog many times and they always refused. My friend still tries to look out for him and takes him to the vet when he needs it. We agreed that if the dog ever gets out of his yard again like he sometimes does that my friend would keep him till i can drive out and get him. My last ditch effort will be to steal him, but the house has cameras, the dogs skittish and might not remember me from a year ago, its not an easy heist. My friends going to try and buy him (i'm giving him the money) since they are neighbors and gotten along and might not refuse him like me. The guy beat his wife and she moved out with the cops today, so my friend is going to offer her a couple grand for the dog.

So for some background, I (20f) started practicing when I was 13. It was something I’d always been interested in and I had previous paranormal/psychic experiences, and essentially I just wanted to see if it would work. Not great intentions to start off with but fuck it worked. My mindset then changed to wanting to see how open I could get, how far I could go. 

I did a lot of research and read a lot of books, but with witchcraft you don’t really know what you’re dealing with. You really do get everything back threefold lmao. I opened myself up way way too fucking much and it became a problem. I’ve talked to multiple psychics/mediums and how they’ve described it is that I’m basically “a walking portal”. Super cool super fun. 

I was around 17 or 18 when things started to get a little out of control, so I shut myself down and haven’t practiced since. Recently I’ve been feeling like I’m ready to get back into it, and I really want to cast a protection spell for the protesters (specifically the ones in Portland), but I’m afraid the second I open myself up to that again the flood gates will open lol. How can I protect myself while casting a protection spell? I’d also love to hear about others experiences and some protection spells/rituals they’ve used! Thank you!",Spells

I’m (23F baby witch) pretty sure someone is either directly or indirectly sending bad vibes my way. I’m usually pretty lucky with not having bad things happen to me, I feel because I try to only put out good. 

Lately it’s been one bad thing after the next. 

1.) My hair has begun falling out, and despite going to get lab work that shows something is a little off, the dr’s office still hasn’t been able to find and read my results, despite the fact I walked the results in and handed them to the front desk 3 weeks ago

2.) just got 4 new tires and one is randomly going flat 

3.) Work has never been more stressful and every little project I work on goes sour one way or another 

4.) My relationship with my bf is very blah and strained recently because of work hours 

5.) I’m stuck in covid quarantine because my friend (who I guess isn’t a good friend?) didn’t tell me she knew she was in contact with someone who knew they were positive, both of which are still going about their life. 

So idk if this could all be chalked up to bad luck and hard times, or if someone is sending bad vibes my way. I feel like my group of friends and co workers get frustrated with me because like I said things usually go my way (I.e good relationship with no cheating or fights, got a raise at work, I live at home with my parents so I don’t have to pay a ton of bills & and have a good family life so I enjoy living at home). Last thing I almost forgot to mention that may be the reason my hair is falling out is I currently have an alter for Aphrodite that I don’t tend to everyday.",Spells

I recently nabbed a gorgeous [Body Candle](https://shopemone.com/products/naked-torso-candle) and am interested in devising a beauty spell. Not a temporary glamour spell, but a long-lasting beauty spell - one which will promote permanent and gradual changes and help me in bringing about the vision I have for myself. I personally have yet to come across any such spells and I know others may be interested in something like this as well. As such, I figured I could ask for some help to come up with a successful spell/ritual which others can use as well.

So far, all I can think of in my limited experience is to carve my name into the candle and burn it (can't decide if over some days or all at once) during the waxing phase (the growing moon symbolic for growing allure) whilst meditating on my intent and visualizing my ideal self. Perhaps I could write a standard petition and place it under the candle as well. These seem like basic and sufficient ideas enough, but I am eager to know if anyone here may have any suggestions to increase the spell's potency or turn it into a full-fledged ritual by incorporating other aspects and ideas to make it even more personalized. I would appreciate any and all advice.

Much thanks!

Did you know that the BIBLE is the best known grimoire, containing magic, rituals, invocations and incantations (or prayers as they are known) I do shudder when thinking of the pain that Christianity caused by saying that a witches grimoire meant being burnt at the stake as opposed to their own bible grimoire.

If you would like to know a little more about this do look at my youtube video [https://youtu.be/936--u3KB3w](https://youtu.be/936--u3KB3w) where I show you my current BOS and how I am going to dedicate my new BOS (to my children to grant them health and happiness throughout their lives) and how this will become a part of the book itself. The spells that I will cast using this new BOS await its pristine pages, but I do know that they will be magic.",Spells

I’m putting together a spell for general health and healing. Physical healing mostly,  but because I believe our physical and mental health is so closely related, anything with mental healing properties is good to know about as well.

i'm curious to know if anyone has any spells related to this that they could share. a generic self love spell may work, however i feel the problem is more deeply rooted than that. it's feeling not good enough...unattractive and undesirable. for context, the girl is someone my current girlfriend used to have a crush on, so i guess thats where it stems from, however none of her exes or other prior flings have caused such terrible feelings for me. 

please help me, i'm desperate to feel better and relax myself. i become nauseous whenever i'm reminded of this girl. i have felt so ugly whenever i see myself. i feel like i'm withering away and its for no ""real"" reason. thank you in advance, i hope you can sense my vulnerability in this post lol. sending love xoxoxoxo",Spells

I have lurked in these group for awhile and finally got reddit and joined. I need a bit of help/advice. I am having a hard time believing in..while anything. I would like to be able to feel something spiritual but I don't know what that something is. I am in my 30's, have been to a lot of different religious places in many countries and though I found them beautiful I never felt anything. I have also gone to many places that are ""haunted"" but also have not had any experience.  Throughout my life I have dabbled in pan-witchcraft, but also never had a connection. All my life I have been told that I am very intuitive and give good predictions for people, but I attribute that to just being good at reading people.

I have digged into the occult already so that's nothing new to me, & i am Satanist/a Gray Witch.

The last post on here (i think) is about the third eye & opening it, the pros & cons, etc. I wanted to comment on there but might gain more traction if I post my own thing. 

Anyways, I see the ""heat wave"" or ""fuzziness"" in the air 24/7 & i can't make it stop, but i can chose to not see it if i so chose. It doesn't scare me at all, I've just always wondered if I accidentally opened my third eye because of this, but i have been practicing Magick for 2 years, & are very good at working with it.

Opening the Third Eye Spell,30,hsbti8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hsbti8/opening_the_third_eye_spell/,5,1594942724.0,"There is so much written about the third eye, i do not know whether it is right or it is wrong as I can only tell you of my experience in opening it.  The first time, i looked up on the net and saw that you should do deep meditation for this, i was instantly dispirited as I have the attention span of a goldfish and am simply unable to meditate for any length of time.

However my guide told me that I should cast a circle first of all.  There are two reasons for this, the first is for protection and safety as when you are psychically open you are psychically vulnerable.   The second is so the circle can magnify your power and ability.  

Like a good trainee I did as I was told, I cast the circle and then sat in it comfortably and gently massaged the third eye area on my forehead.  Then I opened my mind to feel any emotions that were coming in.  I also noted how my eyesight was behaving as I kept on seeing a fuzziness in the air, like a heat haze, which shimmered and glimmered around a certain area.  The fuzziness in the air turned out to be a spirit, my spirit guide in fact and he at that time told me that should I choose to open my mind to the occult, I cannot ever properly close it, i can tune out of it, but never shut it off.  He asked me if I was willing to carry on, and being young I said, without hesitation, yes.  

If he asked me the same question now, I am not sure what I would do, There is great things that came from realising my pyschic side, the mediumship, the wonder, the magic and the awe at the world.  However I have now encountered many many less salubrious forms and having to deal with those is scary, anger making, difficult, tiring and emotionally draining. Am I happier for it?  On the whole I think yes.  Or at least more resigned.

I'm a witch and I haven't done much magick in a while. I do NOT identify as Wiccan so please don't remind me about the Rede etc.. I'm very selective about what I send out into the Universe and my reasons for doing it. Now that we have that out of the way lol. My boyfriend asked me for the first time if I could work a healing spell for a friend of his (Jason) for his parents.. They're not super close though.

Long story short, they both have Covid. Both of them had to go to the hospital. The father is healing slowly, and the mother had to be sent back to the hospital from having a relapse of it... 

From what my partner has told me about them, they're all Christian. But they're good Christians, not the kind that shove their religion down your throat (I speak from experience of that). Good people. They're the type of people where if they were to receive an extra penny in change, they'll give it right back to you... 

Question is, do I really need consent to cast a healing spell on them? I did explain to my boyfriend that I would prefer to obtain consent than to just do it because energy work can have unpredictable outcomes even if you do everything right. Ask me how I know... I once made my own combination of a binding & truth spell on a family member. Boy did that give me more than I wanted... But it worked very quickly, I'm talking less than 24 hours quick. I got what I needed to hear though..

The tricky part is the parents of Jason are religious, but this is a serious situation for all involved, not just one but two of his parents are being harmed by this virus right now. You would assume he would say yes immediately if asked for consent at this point right?

As a researcher, I strongly believe in participating in studies, especially those relevant to me. Consider taking this one, it took me only 5 minutes, and sharing with others!

*This is not my study. Some people have claimed that this census is a scam, but after browsing the website, it looks legitimate to me. However I am not sure how this information will be used or is being protected. I reached out to the researchers to get more information though, and will update you all.

UPDATE: Meg, one of the organizers, responded to my email. For questions about confidentiality she said to refer to the FAQ at the beginning of the survey. Also, any feedback that you all have should be sent to info@witchwithme.com. She also writes that the survey is purely voluntary and is not a scientific study (it for fun). Not sure if that makes them exempt from IRB approval though.

"Honey jar spell, I believe it works",37,hpcvvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hpcvvi/honey_jar_spell_i_believe_it_works/,8,1594513717.0,"Did it twice, it worked the first time and I disposed of the contents of that jar. Because reasons. It took around a week or so for me to see the results. From that point on, it's up to you to continue with what the honey jar spell has started. For me, I did not continue with what the spell made after disposing of the contents.

The second time I did it, kinda manifested around the same time as the first one. I won't dispose of it yet and see how far it will take me. I'm still kinda waiting for something else to happen that's why.

So here's what I did, I lit a red candle(you can use pink or both candles) then wrote a petition. The petition is written in the present tense. No wishing, just wrote things that I want to happen in the present tense. Like ""love is always with me"". Folded it up, added some of the candle wax on the paper to ""seal"" it  and placed it in the glass jar. Filled it with honey, cinnamon powder and brown sugar. On top of the lid, I placed the lit candle(or both if you used 2) and let it burn. While it is burning, I stared at the flame and kept my heart and mind focused on what I want. Place it somewhere only you can touch and see it so that you can put your energy to it everytime.

Here are some other stuff that you can add too. These are optional which I believe will strengthen the spell. You can add photos, write runes across the petition and put other herbs(herbs/plants that represent love). You can also make your own chant/prayer while holding the jar to add energy to it. Do it as frequent as you can and have love in your heart while doing it.

The best thing is that you believe that it will work. Don't let your feelings of love falter. It may take some more time for others or it may take less. You'll see or feel the results. For me, before the events happened, I felt very uneasy like I'm super anxious and nervous. Then after a few hours, it happened. Not gonna say what, but something happened that involves the spell.

Anyway, I believe any honey jar spell will work as long as your intentions and belief on it is strong and it will manifest. Good luck to all of you and I hope this helps you too. I wish you all the best.",Spells

Hello everyone! 

Like pretty much everyone else in the world, my SO and I have really been struggling through this pandemic. He already has clinical anxiety and depression (which is being treated medically) but the pandemic has really made things even worse. He has made it very clear that he is not unhappy with me or our relationship, but that he is just miserable in general. He hates his job, his boss, and his co-workers,(poorly run company not taking care of their employees during the pandemic) and while home is not something he hates, he is so miserable that the few hours he is at home don't really provide him with relief or the ability to relax, and every company in our area is on a hiring freeze until the pandemic is over. Our relationship has suffered because of this, bc he is almost always on edge, and he has no energy or motivation to engage. He spends most evenings on reddit (not this forum though!) before collapsing in bed, where he doesn't sleep well at all. 

I was thinking about maybe doing a honey jar to sweeten his thoughts of me and his thoughts of home. So that home is a place he doesn't have the weight of everything pressing on him, and that thinking of me/home brings him comfort during his day. 

I thought about including a cord with 7 knots, a rose quartz, some of his hair, some of my hair, and then also the paper with the spell on it. Are there any other ingredients you'd recommend? I'm not really sure what to write on the paper, on the part where I write my intention over and over without lifting the pen. I'm looking for some combination of the following

 ""Our home is a place of love and joy"" 

""Your struggles fall away in our home"" 

""Our home and our relationship brings you comfort and joy"". 

Other spell/magical suggestions are most welcome,
Maybe something I could sprinkle around our doors so that when he crosses the threshold he feels relaxed?

This is my ethical love spell that will guarantee you being noticed.  You will become the most physically attractive that you can be and the most spiritually attractive that you can be.

Take equal quantities of meadow sweet, honeysuckle and rose petals and cover them with a plain vegetable oil.  Using your wand, circle above the pot of petals and say

”I ask the flowers to place their intent within this oil, to ensure that I cross paths with my soulmate, and meet my lover, whilst being heightened in beauty and spirit’.

Before I went to bed I put water and crystals near my window to cleanse and looked up at the moon with hope and love. It was my first time ever doing that as I just started looking into magick and it’s properties. I went to sleep and at around 4AM I had sleep paralysis with an intense sensation throughout my body and a mans voice saying “fear not fool”. I then woke up feeling insanely energized and my cat immediately jumped and laid on me. Hasn’t moved off me sense. At first I was terrified and felt crazy, but now I’m feeling sort of comforted. I’m not sure what I’m looking for out of this post but has this happened to anyone? Is this normal for a charging ritual? Over an hour later I still feel very energized. I’m all sorts of confused.

Edit: I’ve had 7 upvotes but no comments, any help or confirmation this is normal is much appreciated! :) I also finally got back to sleep and feel a lot better. Much more calm.

Edit 2: I lit protective incense, put salt in all 4 corners of my bedroom, under the bed and across the door, put holy moon water in all four corners of my room, on my bed and under my bed and chanted the following: 

“If you’re here as a guide I welcome you on my journey, I banish you if you are not”.

I have an onyx crystal water bottle I filled with moon water and placed it under my bed. 

I have crystals next to my bed and some in my pillows.

By this time I’d tripped over a chair, smacked my shin into a board, and getting into the car the door wasn’t open enough and banged the side of my head on the door. Arrrgggg 🤣 

So anyways, use the black crystal and absorb all of it, then the idea is to take it away. So then what I do is go somewhere and release it from my crystal. Hold it up and blow on it. And say “now go”

As we have gotten older she has gotten more manipulative and mean. It’s at a point that if I try to stand up for myself she will try to ruin my life and my relationships. We work together and live together still. when I first moved back home after a bad breakup I started working with her Because I didn’t have a car and I live in a small town (she is a boss and makes way more than me) so offered to help me I rode with her we live together, same shift so she never had to go out of her way.

She has said things about me to coworkers when I wasn’t there and I care about what they think I don’t want her to lie and tell everyone I was the horrible one when I was only sticking up for myself. she has threatened to break the stuff in my room in the past and she will steal from me. I’ve gotten a lock for my door but I’m paranoid she has stolen the spare key. Her reasoning for trying to make me stay is because I “used” her for a ride and I’m a self center and I only worry about myself 24/7 and im constantly screwing her over and these are the things she tells people I’m friends with at work. She also tells me her car is breaking and she won’t be able to make it to work and if I quit I’m screwing her over and she will lose her job. her car is fine and she blows her money all the time and never spends money to “fix” it.

Sex Drive Spell,49,he66gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/he66gw/sex_drive_spell/,4,1592908027.0,"Baby witch here, so bear with me!

I've been having trouble getting in the mood with my partner. I'm not sure why - I'm VERY happy with my partner, who is so so understanding when I'm just not feeling it and when we DO have sex, it's incredible so I'm not sure why I don't want it ALL THE TIME. But, be it stress or lack of confidence or what have you, I rarely feel sexual at all.

So, as with most things since I've begun practicing, I got witchy with it!

Keep in mind: this is what works for ME. Everyone is different and you have to find your own power and your own way! But this works WONDERS for me personally.

All you need is:
2 candles (1 red, 1 white)
Essential oils for anointing (I used lavender, rosemary, red grapefruit, and rose - romantic scents, but feel free to substitute with what you like personally!)
A shower!

So I rub both candles down with the oil while whispering my intentions (""I am sexual. I am sensual. I am passionate."") Then with oil still on my fingers, I draw a line down my chest. Then I lit both candles and let them burn while I got into a hot shower.
While in the shower, I imagine all of my insecurities being washed away. I picture them swirling down the drain as I clean myself and breathe in the smell from the oils and the candles. I still put forth my intentions - ""I am a goddess. I am powerful. I am beautiful.""
Once out of the shower: I blow out both candles, pour the wax from the red candle onto the white candle, relight the white candle, and let it burn in the bedroom until...you know...afterwards!

Pretty sure I’m cursed,8,he1s9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/he1s9j/pretty_sure_im_cursed/,13,1592891943.0,"So, I’m pretty sure I’m cursed but would like others opinions on this. About a year and a half ago terrible things started happening to me and my partner. We have friends into the occult and it seems these bad things happen around then or after seeing them. I got an awful job that caused serious mental harm no matter how hard I tried. My favorite necklace went missing after said friend complimented it. My partner ended up breaking a bone and having a terrible experience at the hospital, my cat died a few weeks after they stayed with us. I got diagnosed with a somewhat rare disease that’s done awful things to my body. I had a terrible trip on drugs and the first person I felt like I had to call was those same friends vs other friends that are closer to me. After video chatting with them my other favorite necklace went missing after they complimented it again. I don’t know how I’d lose it when I’ve barely left the house. I’ve also been having the most terrible time at work and had multiple emotional breakdowns and can’t seem to do anything right since the bad trip, but that could be due to the pandemic and the terrible systematic racism we have in the world. 

I’ve been having nightmares and most recently I had a walking stick cactus monster in it that was extremely bizarre. In the same dream my brother died and I woke up crying. He has been sick the last few weeks but teeth pain and a pinched nerve in his back, nothing serious. 

Today, out of no where, I felt I might have been cursed and had a weird feeling. I usually don’t believe in these things but it just kind of clicked in my mind. I feel crazy even typing this out which is why I’m on an alt account. Any thoughts on if this could be one or not? I have a new cat that I’m worried might get sick or die because of this and I want to be safe. Not to mention my own safety and my partners or families.",Spells

Litha sun energy talisman,19,hctr9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hctr9r/litha_sun_energy_talisman/,0,1592715881.0,"Today I celebrated my first Litha as officially pagan. I wanted to make or do something special and decided I wanted to make my self a talisman to contain solar energy. Sharing is caring so I thought I'd post what I did here incase anyone finds it useful.

For background, I have depression & anxiety. I find it gets worse in the winter due to the lack of sunlight. My intent for this talisman was to capture or soak up the midsummer solar energy into an object that I can then tap into in the darker months if I find I'm struggling.

I used a bipoint sunstone crystal with one end larger than the other, orange jewelry wire and some wax. I left the sunstone and wire out from just after dawn until sunset in full sunlight to soak up as much energy as possible. 

At sunset, I lit a candle and incense and used the wire to fashion a net or cage tight around the crystal to contain and support it. I started at the bottom, ensuring the lower, larger point was accessible and wove up to the thinner point. Whilst I did this I meditated and visualised solar energy as a golden, glowing liquid flowing into the top of the crystal like water into a vase. Once I visualised it as full, I mentally and physically sealed it by winding the wire into a clasp (so I can hang it round my neck if needed) and placed hot wax from the candle around the top of the crystal and cage. I then keep it in my hands until my incense stopped burning and said ""So mote it be.""

I'm really pleased with how it came out. It's currently sitting on my altar for inspection by the ethereal beings that visit and then I will seal it away safely until winter. I plan to access the energy by pressing the base point against my skin and meditating on it.",Spells

A spell to partially cut of a toxic family member,4,hbmycj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hbmycj/a_spell_to_partially_cut_of_a_toxic_family_member/,1,1592542939.0,"Context:

My dad has been toxic for as long as I can remember. He has caused my sister, my mom, and I a great deal of frustration and emotional hurt and trauma over the years.

My parents divorced when I was in 4th or 5th grade and I still live with my mom. Due to me not being able to have my own insurance (currently unemployed and my job didn’t offer the best insurance) I still have to remain in contact with him just to please him and remain on his insurance plan.

He doesn’t contact me a lot but he is aware of the fact that I’m still a college student. Many college students, such as my mom’s fiancé’s children, don’t talk to their parents due to being busy at college. My dad doesn’t understand that.

He gets very angry when I don’t call or send a small message, blows things out of proportion, etc. (I can provide more examples if needed) I don’t know how to say this lightly but I really wish my dad wasn’t around. He causes too much emotional distress for me than what it’s worth.


My question: 

With that said, I still need to have a form of contact to stay on his insurance a little longer but I want him out of my life for the most part. Is there a spell I could perform to cut this toxic family member out of my life? I’m sick of being emotionally drained by him..he has never once given me a burst of happy or good energy.

Midsummer Rituals,25,hbkip5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/hbkip5/midsummer_rituals/,1,1592535227.0,"Every year at Midsummer witches gather around their bonfires.  This is one of the most ancient of festivals - possibly the one that was first ever observed by ancient man, and still has the same magick and pull today as it ever did.

Witches of the light (as to those who worship the Old One) would offer up thanks to the great Goddess of the sun, praising and thanking her for setting the sun on its annual path so that the seasons pass in their order.   Wiccans/Neo-Pagans know her as Litha but I have always known her by the ancient Anglo Saxon name of Fritha, guardian of the sun and one of the twelve great Earth Spirits. 

For further enlightenment on this years festival you could watch this short video [https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4](https://youtu.be/bLXnstji0H4) As a fourth generation witch - whilst growing up, I thought bonfires at dawn, halloween rituals and Yule logs a plenty was perfectly normal, just part of our yearly celebration.  It is only with age comes hindsight!

Because each midsummer falls at a slightly different time, there are different spells that come to pass due to the alignment of the stars.  Midsummer’s eve falls on the 19th June with the sun reaching its ‘stopping point’ at 1.04pm (UK time - and in Devon) on the 20th June.  So this year it proceeds the suns move into Cancer, which has considerations for the hearth, happiness and the home.  A spell therefore at Midsummer asking Fritha to bless the hearth and home with happiness, will slowly build until its fruition on 30th December 2020 - the suns next show in Cancer.",Spells

I have let go of A LOT of people in the past few years with a heavy emphasis on the last 6 months. I turned 31 in March so I believe (and hope) that I am wrapping up my Saturn return. 

I feel content with whom I’ve let go of. It’s hard, such an adjustment but I feel like I did the right thing. But now I feel ...It’s like I was moving and purged so much, now all I have is the home...nothing inside. 

*** I would like to know if anyone has any advice on spells or ways to manifest the people/jobs/ things that are meant for me. I don’t want to wait around. I want to make things happen. 🤞🏽🙏🏽

I don’t really even know what’s meant for me, but I guess that’s normal? I have chronic illnesses and no job, no romance, and now I have only 2 friends. 

I know I want better for myself..I want to be able to manage my illnesses so well that I can function more often than not, though I can only control my health so far. I want a job where I can write, do outreach and uplift my community. I want to make wonderful friends. I want a compassionate and kind romantic partner. & I really really want to be HAPPY more often than not. 

I don’t know how to draw these things to me. How to draw in the opportunities or the right people. Especially in the midst of covid and my new(ish) illnesses. 

I’m sorry if this is a bit of a mess. Being in this space is sooooooo new to me. I never let people go when I should. I never put myself first. So it’s been a weird time trying to identify my feels.

Is it true for benefits you gain from spell you often take something away from another person?,2,h9s8kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h9s8kg/is_it_true_for_benefits_you_gain_from_spell_you/,2,1592294923.0,"I was told by a veteran witch to be careful about spellcasting because every benefit you get be it gaining a suitcase of luggage or having sex with a gorgeous girl and gaining physical strength all come from somewhere else (often indirectly stealing from another person). For example if you cast a money spell and found $50 on the ground in the next day............. That $50 was probably lost by someone while he or she was traveling. It didn't just pop out of thin air. For all we know  the person was a girl who needed that cash to get  taxi fare home. Because she somehow lost that 50 bucks as a result of the spell, she had to travel home. She could have been grabbed from behind, dragged to the bushes, and raped. Or she could have slipped and fallen on broken glass and hurt. If nothing dangerous happens at all, she still has to walk home. Maybe she gets lucky after she realizes she has no fare when she attempts to call for a nearby Taxi in traffic but her brother happens to also be in the same traffic line and sees her and calls on her to just join him and save cash. Whatever the results, she still lost $50.

A more worldly example can be seen by a quote the witch sent me in the chatroom.

>If I see a gorgeous girl on a street corner, and want to go do some kind of work to cause her to run over and sleep with me, the butterfly effect is in play. Let's say she does immediately run over to me.

>Let's say there is a man driving a car through the intersection who normally would have slowed to look at the girl, but since I tilted the machine, she isn't there. The guy coming the other way that runs the red light would have missed this man if she were there, but since she isn't, there is a horrific, T-bone wreck. The car rolls. It badly injures both drivers, and brutally kills an innocent 4 year old girl right in front of her mother, just for being on the sidewalk.

>How much of that is my fault? I didn't run the red light, I didn't tell the mother and daughter to go for a walk... The LHP answer is it wouldn't be my fault, because everyone is just doing their thing and shit happens. My answer is a good chunk is my fault. I didn't run the red light, but I tilted the fucking machine because I knew how and just wanted something for myself, and most people are stuck just playing with the 2 bottom paddles. If I hadn't done that, there would be no accident. I also know what I am doing, I know tilting the machine is unfairly slanting things in my favor, and that makes a higher standard apply to me. I know what I am doing and I know better.

BTW the witch is actually female but she was using the above example to me since I'm a guy to help me understand better how an innocent spell like finding a friend with benefits can have devastating consequences lol!

But still is what she warns against a legitimate part of sorcery and a basic functioning of spellcasting? For example if I'm having bad health issues because of old age and cast a spell and a week later I somehow regain my youthful athleticism, was that bodybuilder energy taken from someone else,probably a young guy in the military? As a result he fails PT and gets discharged, meaning he loses his house and his family suffers as a result with his kids starving and homeless?

I am very curious and her warning is why I am hesitate to do spellcasting right now! How true is her statement?",Spells

How do aerosol sprays of traditional herbs and other ingredients and potions work?,3,h8g4k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h8g4k3/how_do_aerosol_sprays_of_traditional_herbs_and/,1,1592112044.0,"I just bought Dr. Pastor Davis John the Conqueror and Attraction aerosol sprays from the local occult shop.

First time I ever bought these. How do they work? Do I spray it on myself? After taking a bath if I do spray it on myself or spray it on my clothes and wash them later, will the effects go away? Do I spray it daily in my room? Will opening the window lead to the effect going away via air leaving the window? Can I spray them on talisman and other items to transfer its specific effects? How long does the effects last after spraying a room or object or person? Does spraying two different substances in the same location potentially complement each or other or cancel each other out and stuff of that sort?

Please help! This is my first time at this!",Spells

Pendulum Dowsing (Quick Start Guide),7,h15x9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/h15x9y/pendulum_dowsing_quick_start_guide/,1,1591931826.0,"As a huge advocate of the pendulum for divining EVERYTHING I thought that I would share my top tips for accurate readings.

Step 1: Ensure that you have cleared all negative energy from your pendulum.  If you are unsure how to do this, then the best start is to wash your pendulum in spring water, dry with cotton.  Place in the sun to heal for an hour, then carry about your person for a further couple of hours to align with your own energy.

Step 2: Place yourself in a room free from drafts and  make sure that fans are off/windows closed

Step 3: Make sure you know what your yes/no swings are.  If in doubt ask questions where the answer is definitely a yes/no, i.e. Am I a cat? Do I have blue eyes? Then you can verify your yes no swing. 

Et Voila! You are now in a position to ask your questions - my latest trick is to find out if dogs are pregnant and how many puppies they will have.  

These, of course are the most basic of tips, for further in depth views watch my vid [https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg](https://youtu.be/X4b9vliNFzg) which will give you a quick start guide in under 10 mins for the pendulum.",Spells

Be it dark or white magic. However, I’ve never asked her how she does stuff or to teach me spells because I didn’t see a reason as to why I needed to learn, partly because I was afraid she might say no. I’ve always been able to “guess” people’s actions. For example, their day to day lives, what they did, what colour shirt they were wearing, what they ate in the morning and small stuff like that. I started realizing something was off when I started experiencing very very detailed and strong deja vus. I’d be doing my own things and then bam, i’ll be hit with a huge weird emotion of “Haven’t I seen/done this before? And isn’t [insert said situation] going to happen after that?” However, I brushed it off thinking it was ridiculous of me.

But recently, i’ve been so so interested and intrigued with the idea of summoning deities. I’ve had dreams and visions of me doing so and every time I’ll end up trying to search ways on ways, and steps to contact them. But i’ve never tried to, because I was afraid I might mess it up somehow. Thus I need your help. Do you have any tips or maybe even steps on summoning deities? Could you please help.

Two weeks ago, I decided to talk to a Pandit Astrologer to give me guidance and hear that my ex isn't the one. He told me the opposite and that there's dark energy surrounding me when it comes to love life, my ex truly loves me, and that there's another girl involved and causing this mess (not true, but I believed it at first). Since I believed everything at first, I paid him to cast the negative energy away and for Vashikaran, which I didn't know was bad.  I realized that putting a love spell on the man I truly truly love was wrong, told my ex all about it, and asked the Pandit to stop the spell, even though he had already begun it the night before. Two days later he calls me saying he confirmed that he would stop doing the love spell. 

Fast forward to this past Saturday, I was casually on TikTok and saw a tarot video saying it was not on my ""fyp"" by mistake. They said similar things- there is a soul connection in my life and they truly love and want to be with me, but are afraid of committing. 

Last night, my ex told me he still has feelings for me and has been thinking about me lately, after seeing me post a screenshot of a match from Hinge. For the record, he did not text me out of the blue, we have been texting each other nearly every day. He said he has been thinking about me lately because we have been texting again. I'm just scared - did he say all those things genuinely, or because of the Vashikaran love spell?

This is unimportant to true knowledge. Your seeking a false relationship based on a controlling factor meaning you don't even like the person you just want to control them leading to they were never a fit for you and creating a bigger problem if it works due to them not even matching up with you.

Change my mind.

Also I'd prefer to see plant energy storage spells. Breaking curses. Making wards and shields for you dwelling. Spells for hiding your street from normal view. Spells for distancing yourself from people who will manipulate your view on your main focus or goal. These should be top priority here. 

Yet love and revenge is all I see. The most fruitless battle. Love creates revenge. Can't have love without hatred. 

I know this goes against rule one and I'll take it down if this truly gets to you guys but still I'm not staying silent anymore. Finding the proper knowledge or true skills to continue in this practice are hidden from the people who need the protection the most from those who seek destruction through mental abuse of forcing fake feelings upon someone who possible wouldn't even mix well in their potion of life.

This is because I had put a ward spell around the perimeter of our property, so when the fire reached the spell line, it stopped.

A spell to help someone who has lost their way,2,gwx6k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwx6k5/a_spell_to_help_someone_who_has_lost_their_way/,0,1591357843.0,"[Cross Posted]

Hello All!

I have a close friend who has been dealing with a lot of pressure and difficulties lately. To deal with these stressors they have decided to run away from their responsibilities and hide in a religious lifestyle. I do not want to pressure them out of that decision. If that's their true path then that's what they need to do. But I worry that they are blinded to their reality and I want to help them be able to sort through their situation in a healthy way. I am a Green Witch, so I very much believe in addressing the root cause of problems, so I have tried my best to have those difficult conversations with them. However, it doesn't seem to be doing any good. I think this all stems from a lack of trust for other people and a fear that they are letting others down, so they are deciding to just give up and hide behind the lens of religion.

I want to do a spell that will help them recognize the totality of the world around them and give them the strength to sort through the issues that may be leading them to make these rash decisions so that they can find their true path -- whatever that may be. I really worry that they are going to follow through on decisions that will lead them to more destruction. I want to help them see the world with true sight; open eyes. I was hoping you lovely folks may have some suggestions on what to include in a spell of this nature.

Thank you!",Spells
Seeking Guidance For Interpretation Of Flame,15,gwuksm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwuksm/seeking_guidance_for_interpretation_of_flame/,0,1591347998.0,"The intention of this post, is to gain insight from experienced practioners who have no ill motives, but only seek to share fact-based wisdom and knowledge. 

Non-consentual manipulation magick: the casting witch has no ill intentions to bring harm, chaos, or destruction to the target; the motive is selfish in nature. The target's identifying details were written on tissue paper, folded, sealed with casting witch's blood, pierced by a needle and unintentionally dropped just prior to entering the candle flame. In an effort to improvise, the needle was secured deeper into the hard wax, and a wooden tool was used to ignite the paper. The flames here initially high and steady. Shortly after, it became shorter and danced, but had two peaks, one on each end with a divot in the middle, showing slight resemblance of a heart. 20 hours later, the paper is still aflame, the candle wick has been drown in wax. The flame is short, small, blue/white, and very steady. The source of the flame doesn't appear to exist. Surely there must be a significant interpretation to this?

Am I cursed with Lycanthropy?,1,gwtvjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gwtvjp/am_i_cursed_with_lycanthropy/,15,1591345408.0,"Greetings, reddit. As you can see, my post is going to be a weird one, that's why I made a completely new reddit account, I never told anyone about what happens to me and there are close people that are checking my main reddit account and I don't want them to find about this yet. Also, English is not my native language so expect some spelling mistakes here and there. I have no idea who I can ask about this stuf honestly...

I never believed in paranormal stuff or curses but I can't ignore what's been happening for the past few years. I know I am not yet very convincing but hear me out, I am genuinely scared and paranoid. Every once in a while, I wake up in the morning really sweaty finding my blankets and pillows all thrown on the floor of my bedroom. I usually sleep naked but there were times when I didn't sleep naked and woke up with my tee either very enlarged (like when you try to pull the collar apart but you fail tearing your t-shirt) or torn.

Sometimes I even find food thrown away in random spots in my flat and the door of the fridge open and everything inside watery (I once had to buy another fridge as the old just stopped functioning properly). My neighbours that live in the same apartment block sometimes think that I am moving doing my workouts or dancing in the middle of the night as they can hear loud bumps coming from my flat (that only happens in the nights prior to these weird mornings) . I'm ashamed to say that sometimes I even find urine marks in the corners.

Another neighbour that is on the same level as me once threw a party in his flat and when people went past my door sometimes they would hear 'a dog growling but not barking' . When he told me that I couldn't control my emotions and I had a cringe-worthy reaction as I am usually a very anxious person and I can't just make up lies without shaking when I'm telling them, let alone when I am face to face with a person that I have to suddenly lie to. I just told him that I had to look after my girlfriend's dog in the end, but it was still weird and he didn't tell me anything about any growling since. (My girlfriend is studying in a different city, close to mine as we're both uni students and she's coming to my place from time to time).

But another old lady that is also my neighbour and leaves at the first level of my block said that the stray dogs from outside bark most of the night. (I know that they do that only or at least mostly when the episodes occur because I meet her in the mornings when I go to uni walking her dog and she always tells me to be careful because there can still be aggressive stray dogs around from last night).    I've considered that I might be sleep walking, but I've never been sleeping walking in my entire life and I never knew how I could check if I am.

I've considered having night-surveillance cameras, but there are multiple issues here: 1. My parents still buy stuff for me and that fridge was also expensive. They usually have to know what I need money for.                        2.  I could use my phone or just a regular old camera that can film, but they don't have a night-view mode and they can just run out of battery. I've got an iPhone and it's screen just locks automatically after a minute. Even if I disable that feature, iphones really run out of battery really fast, I tried filming for half an hour and its battery was dead afterwards.                       3. I am scared of what I would see. Even if it's just sleepwalking. I've seen other videos of that with people just talking in their beds with their eyes open and that was still creepy. Let alone me growling, pissing and doing all that mess when I never ever done that in my life (I casually asked my parents at one point if I used to sleepwalk when I was really young and they said that I didn't).

Obviously, I've seen a lot of stories/myths about lycanthropy and I was really creeped out. I am curious if you guys believe in such things. These episodes don't happen regularly (and yes, without exaggerating, they did happen on full-moon nights as well).

I am curious about your opinions. Am I way too paranoid? I've only anonymously asked a witch from my country about her opinion on my issue and she suggested I may be a werewolf and since then I'm paranoid and there's just anxiety everytime I try to sleep.

I tried making this post as easy to read so possible. Feel free to ask for more details. It's the weirdest thing in my life and I genuinely don't know who I can ask about this. Thank you for your time!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: I really appreciate your answers! I am still looking for more opinions before I make a decision regarding this issue. I'll be honest with myself and you guys.",Spells

I don't want a love spell. Read the whole post, I don't want him back, it would never work. Stop sending me messages about it.

So I don't want to dump all my laundry in this post, but the story is that, when I was in high school, I had a boyfriend who I deeply adored. He was wonderful, so sweet and kind, my best friend and I loved him. The problem was, I'm aromantic (which means that I don't experience romantic attraction to anyone), although I didn't yet know it at the time. So I knew that I loved him, but it wasn't in the same way that he loved me. It started to cause friction between us, and I eventually had to break up with him. We graduated the next year and I haven't seen him since. It's been about five years and I still think about him a lot.

I carry around a lot of guilt and emotional baggage because of the whole situation. I miss him so much, but I also don't want to intrude on his life by seeking him out again because I know I hurt him, and what would be the point, anyway? It's not like we could just get back together, because I'm aromantic and he's not. He deserves someone who can love him the way he loved me.

Communication Spell,16,goi6g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/goi6g8/communication_spell/,11,1590178178.0,"Hi! I have never cast a spell before, so I was hoping to gain some advice and wisdom from you all. 

My ex recently broke up with me because I was going through a lot in my life at the moment such as my mom being sick and starting a new job. Therefore, I was very distant with him and less affectionate. We'd only just started dating when all this occurred, so I didn't get to tell him how much these things were affecting me and why I was being so distant because he blocked me almost immediately after breaking up. But I'm in a much better place now, and I'm ready to start a relationship with him again.

So I'm looking for advice on how to cast a communication spell or something to get him to unblock me and open up to me and allow me to message him the situation I was in and why that was causing me to be so distant in hopes that he'll give me another chance. Thank you!!

By the way, if anyone is curious, I did try to go talk to him in person, but I did it on a day when I was feeling very sick due to a headache, and nothing came out right. Which is why I'd rather do it through text instead :)",Spells
Get into medicine spell?,2,gofhkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/gofhkx/get_into_medicine_spell/,4,1590164995.0,"I have a chance to get into medicine this year at a specific uni which does not require a test such as the ucat (mcat in the USA). (I'm from Australia), I have always wanted to be a doctor and I feel this is my chance. I have almost finished all of my prerequisites just maths left which is almost done.

This uni requires a high gpa ( at least 6.0 out of 7.0 to be competitive). I won't say my gpa but it is in that range. I have been trying for years and I want this year to be successful for me in terms of me getting into medicine at the specific uni.

I am looking for a spell with a combination of results, is this possible to do? For example, I need to finish my maths before July this year, find volunteering work as soon as possible (which is hard with coronavirus at the moment), get a medical interview this year for next years medical course, and be successful in the medical interview for me to get into 2021's medical course.

Is it possible to do such a spell which would result in all of these results? What do I need? Should I do a manifestation spell? Do I burn or bury it? Do I bury it to metaphorically ''make it grow into a tree''? Or do I do that only at the end of the spell once I achieve my goals. Do I have a to sacrifice something? I heard people sacrifice their fertility with blood magic because it is really strong magic, or make a deal with spirits that they will be riencarnated into their children.

Please give me as much information as you can, I have already done a petition paper spell, but want to do more spells to boost the spell. Also, with the intention spell, should I only burn/bury it  after it comes true or right now to send my intention out to the unverse?

I am new to magic but have a little knowledge.

Please help me, I am desperate and will be grateful for your information.",Spells

I’m dying. I’m literally at my wits end with my husband and 3 kids who are complete slobs and never clean up after themselves. I had fibro along with a list of other issues endocrine related mainly that keep me feeling like complete shit and making my Adderall and antidepressants no longer work like they used to before having my last baby in 2016.  My husband does do most of the housework now and cooking (always) (lost his job in March) but, his lives the definition of insanity in all areas of his life and it’s making me fucking crazy after 11 1/2 years. Hell clean the entire kitchen just to make a meal and than immediately destroy it because he lacks the insight to clean as you go even though I’ve begged him for years. This is literally all we fight about. Not money, not religion, but how he fails to throw shit in the garbage right after opening a package of something like a can of dog food. I’m getting so angry just writing this. 

I have 10 year old twins who are also the same way now they were born severely premature at 23 weeks weighing barely a pound and my son suffers from sensory processing disorder which makes it difficult for him to be in the world around us. He’s extremely high functioning he just forgets to close cabinets, car doors, clean up any mess he makes etc. My daughter is better than all the rest, but definitely needs help too. Than comes the 3 year old who leaves a tornado in her path and than fights with me tooth and nail to clean it up. I’m trying not to create another entitled kid because with the twins being my first and being so premature with developmental disabilities their first 5 years and being first time mom I definitely babied them too much. However they were a lot easier to control than my full term 3 year old daughter Juniper (Juni for short). She’s inherited a lot of my personality and already know she’s going to give me hell. 

I’m a Taurus sun (cancer moon airies rising) so I’m as stubborn as they come, but man she’s already exhausting me.  In my chart my environment is incredibly important to my mental health. Do you have any spells for a beginner as I don’t typically practice magic(k) but, appreciate and really enjoy learning about esoteric knowledge (and pretty much everything else so I can never commit to anything).  I did purchase a spirit doll who was supposed to help with motivation, but didn’t feel she was working and put her away with Christmas stuff. Thanks a million in advance. Sorry for the length.

Today I'm looking for a spell to protect another being from the influence of negative words. I don't know what to search to be able to find it, so I thought of asking here first.

The thing is, even though my bf is the sweetest person ever, he can't seem to have enough patience with one of our cats (the one who he feels the least affinity with, that ends up being the one that I feel the most affinity with), and at the first sign of she doing something wrong, he bursts into rage and start screaming with her, calling her idiot and so on.

I know that words have power and they can influence the wellbeing of another being in a biological level (there's a study with plants that were grown with compliments vs curse words/pejorative words/negative words. Surprise: the latter rotted and died in a matter of days.), so I'm looking for something to protect her from it.

Get your red candle and write the person's name on one said  and draw a heart after it then add your name directly in front of them. It must be like this: John Smith ♥️ Jane Doe.
Now write in your candle what you want, Love... Reconciliation... Be certain of what you want and write specific words. Draw more hearts on the candle. Draw the Nordic Rune that is associated with love. 

Now oint the candle with some oil. Optional part (if you wanna make the spell stronger prick your finger with a CLEAN needle and rub the blood on your loved one's name)

After doing all that put the candle on top of the mirror and sprinkle some grounded cinnamon to make it work faster.  Now that you're done meditate on your candle, pray for Aphrodite, promise her you'll thank her a lot if your wish become true.

He has depression, anxiety etc... And I wanted to help him. This is not something special because those days I used to listen to people with depression and stress to help them in some way ( I did have loads of posts too) because I am having depression for years.

We went on talking and then he ghosted me for two days, I was concerned and I sent him messages asking what happened. He came back later and said that he was too depressed. Then we started talking normal again and then he said that he's sick and started ghosted me.  After 30 days he came back and said that he was suicidal. Now he's ghosting me again.

Second time posting here. I don't know what to do. I have previous post about a spell i did on a specific person.

It was binding, and used blood also. I did the unbinding, this was like three months ago done. Everything went fine, life goes on smoothly, i don't even think of the person, he barely contacts me. Friendly talk two times over the past month, and thats it.

This man is taken, it is said in my previous post.

So now, three months after everything, unbind and all. Suddenly he contacts again, i am occupied with life, and other stuff, i don't have time for nonsense. In meantime i do delete his phone number, and block him on social media. What entered into me, what happened. I unblocked the guy, and i even dared to go so far to threaten him with exposing him what scum of person is he. 

He begs not to, rationally i understand, i don't want to ruin other peoples lives, but here comes this rage, anger hate pointed towards him. Its like i want what he took ftom me back, metaphorically speaking, i want my peace back, my life normal again.

I see that he doesnt care for noone beside himself, he steps on the dignity of others, and i want everyone to see that, that his nonchalant behaviour is exactly that, he doesn't care for noone beside saving his own skin. 

And i cant have that, and these pushing thoughts, like a compulsions, but aren't compulsions. Its pure hate.

From psychological point i can understand why i feel this way, but a year have passed by, and i am no longer with him, i dont even like him. On the opposite i dislike him.

Its simply all hate against him and his better half, more towards him. I want her to see what scum he is, i want everyone to see what a trash of person he is. He took part of me, i can't retrieve them. I cant even sleep from all this shifting energy of hate toward him. I want him to suffer at least half the way i do, and i was suffering. I want that more than anything.

I know that there will be judging toward me, believe me. There isn't a word that i havent said to my self, i even felt guilt, he didnt, confessed straightforward

I bear the guilt of his doings and mine too, the burden is hard, and there isn't a day that i don't judge myself because of going with that guy through that path.

When I see him now on posts with his family, the hate grows, more and more and more. I want him to suffer everyday, like i do. Or to retrieve to me my peace and to go to hell.

Thanks to anyone. Judgmental or no, i cant find the trye answer why i feel so much hate. I hate him with every inch of my soul.",Spells

Due to medical reasons I often have trouble finding apartments in which I can live without getting more sick or being heavily limited in my day to day life. That's why I made a really elaborate ritual in which I enchanted a large quartz to hold and reinforce my intent to find a great apartment this summer. I meditated with and charged the crystal multiple times and by now I feel a large current of my intent swirling around it whenever I touch it. I tried to specify everything I need, down to in which time frame I needed to find a new place to live. Having a safe space to life is the most important thing for me to be able to complete my studies because the last time I moved cities to uni the first time, the first apartment I was in made my illness flare up so bad, that even now, nearly two years later I still am worse than before. That's why I poured so much energy in my spell, because finding such an apartment is essential for finishing my bachelor's degree (and later master's).

And that's where my problem lies: due to the same medical reasons I mentioned above I am at high risk and since everything uni related is online now I will not be moving back there anytime soon. And now I fear that since my needs are different now the spell won't do anything and it will be for nothing or that it even backfire somehow. So here's my question: can I chance or modify my spell without destroying/disrupting what I already made? What should I do?

Sub Rule Clarifications,23,ga0jwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ga0jwh/sub_rule_clarifications/,0,1588153936.0,"Hello!

The forum rules have been updated.  The intention of the rules remain unchanged--to provide a safe and content-rich forum where people can knowledge-share about magick.  The wording of the rules was simply updated to improve clarity and communication.  

In particular, the old ""No off-topic"" rule was problematic--people who didn't read the pinned post or expand the off-topic rule to read the full text were unaware that advising mundane solutions rather than magickal solutions was prohibited.  When PMed, people overall were very apologetic, they simply didn't know.

To fix that, the rules have been rewritten so that the expectations around comments are visible above the fold, and a few other minor wording tweaks have been made.

Please avoid posting that you think someone shouldn't be doing magick.  That is explicitly prohibited on this forum; it isn't what people come here to read.  If you feel you absolutely must tell someone your opinion, you can always send a private message.

And please use the report function if you see someone violating a rule.  We don't ban people for first-time off-topic rule violations.  We simply remove the comments and PM them asking them to stop.

Thank you for helping to keep this sub a safe and content-rich forum!",Spells

So many bubbles and some connected to eachother, needles all throughout the water with bubbles attached to them and what looked to me a skull figure. There were also those chunky white pieces at the bottom which means REALLY negative energy (if you’re familiar with this form of divination hopefully youll know what I mean by this).

He wasn’t engaged anymore so I messaged that girl just to see what was going on, if he pulled the same shit on her as he did me and what do you know, sure did. We basically just talked about how terrible he was and god knows who else he’s done this to.

First of all, this is nothing I plan to do. In fact even if I knew it was possible I would not do it because it's not ethical and I would not like to be with someone I knew was forced to love me. Also I suppose these kind of things will bite you in your ass one way or another.

HELP! PROTECTION SPELL GONW WRONG,18,g2do29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/g2do29/help_protection_spell_gonw_wrong/,12,1587067551.0,"PROTECTION SPELL/RITUAL GONE WRONG.

I had a tarot reading with a spiritual reader. He not only reads tarot cards but he can feel energies and communicate with spirits. 

During my reading we discussed many things about my life which was pretty positive until I asked about a specific member of my childrens family. He told me that she had been doing witchcraft against me and he immediately said yes (i didn’t want to know what exactly just how to protect myself). This was obviously worrying but made sense as there had been somethings happening that I couldn’t explain before.


He told me in order to protect myself I needed to get a doll that resembled me, an amethyst crystal, rosemary and cut my nail or hair and put them all together in a small black drawstring bag. I would have to sleep with this bag under my pillow for seven days. On the seventh day I would need to bury it until a plant or something that would eventually grow roots under it which would form this protection. 

On the seventh day I went to bury it. But found myself in a situation. The place I had gone to bury it was in my community garden but I was not expecting anyone to be there as I’d gone in the night. There was a woman there that refused to let me be there as she believed I didn’t live there even though I did. A man then came to kick me out. He pushed me and the woman spat on me on top of many insults like hoping I would get coronavirus. It was terrible. I had not had an experience like this since I was child and it was a quite traumatic. I believe this was a spiritual attack. Why would this happen on a day I was supposed to finalise this protection spell? 

Anyways I left, found somewhere else to bury it and then went home. The next day it rained so I felt like it was a good sign, the plant was given something to help it grow over.

After two days I went back to where I’d buried it to check on it and I noticed a hole where the bag was. Someone had taken it. I cannot believe it. Who would do this? And why? Especially after seeing the contents surely they would just put it back? But no. It had completely disappeared and I could not see it anyway in the area. I felt shaken and afraid that someone could do something bad with it which would directly affect me. 

I couldn’t sleep properly for days. I also couldn’t get into contact with the reader either so it’s fair to say I’ve been worried ever since. 

Please can someone advice me on what to do next?

Should I leave it alone?

Should I do the ritual again?

Should I do something else?

I would really appreciate any positive answers as I haven’t been able to talk to anyone in my life about this as the people around me would not approve of this. 

Thank you in advance!

I’ve been advised to do it again. This time using my own plant pot and keep it in my home.",Spells

While I’ve been battling with depression for years, I feel like it’s gotten worse, and aggravated Even more so by a streak of life altering bad luck.

Honey Jar Advice,12,fvdqbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fvdqbg/honey_jar_advice/,3,1586121847.0,"I was on another forum and someone suggested I try a honey jar because I'm new to spellcasting and they can have powerful effects in heightening someone's attraction. I won't get into the back story, but I made my jar last week. I used Google for my information (again at the suggestion of someone on the other forum, and because you know...quarantine) and put in honey, my paper with our names in crosses and my affirmation in a circle around it, and part of his old toothbrush. I did not have access to an ""actual"" candle so I lit a birthday candle which was red and white intertwined (I read online that white can be used for any purpose and the candle itself doesn't matter). When the candle burned down the wick had tied into itself like a pretzel knot so I thought that was a good sign. I put the jar in my basement and was going to forget about it.

Doing more research the next day it says you should work on the jar either for 7 days or every M W F until the effects start to become apparent. I also read that if you want to sweeten the attraction further you can add cinnamon and vanilla to the jar. There seemed to be mixed reviews online as to whether to open a jar or not after sealing it, so I went with my gut and opened it to add the extra ingredients. After adding the extra ingredients I lit a new red candle that I bought at the store. This candle is one of those thicker taller circle ones that burns slow and doesn't drip. I dressed it in honey, vanilla, cinnamon, and rose oil before lighting it. I did my meditation and stated my affirmation again as I had done the first night. The candle burns so slow I figured I can burn it down over the 7 day period. I find myself sitting and meditating while it burns from anywhere from 1-3 hours a night. The candle is about halfway down now. 

After the second night of burning someone I don't know sent me a random picture of my target online. It was completely unprovoked and the sender did not know that I know his friend (target). I know that is one of the signs that the jar is working (they say you randomly run into your target places, communication picks up, whatever it may be). Since I am starting to see minimal effects should I put the jar back into my basement once the candle finally finishes burning down? How often should I be working on my jar and am I overworking it right now because I unintentionally chose a slow burning candle? I know honey jar spells are slow to work but how long should I wait before deciding my spell is or isn't working effectively? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am in a state where i am torn apart between what i did, and moral standards.

I expect the hate and suing, and its understandable for me. I already sue myself, and can't forgive for what i did.

So long story short, i have this guy, we were in a messed up relationship, where i was the third wheel. He already had/and has someone. But i fell in love with him so hard, never thought i could. When i first saw that guy, i was repulsed and i thought no way, not my type. 3 months passed and i was crazy for him. I guess karma came for my way of  thinking so low for him. And i fell in love so hard, we were in a relationship, and i broke it, i didn't saw a way for us to be together and broke things off. But the guy was pushing constantly to meet up, call me, message me casually. The deal was, we broke up, but stay friends, i said okay.

But he was pushing things further, and even though i subtly told him to leave me alone, and no contact he didn't respected that. Months passed, and i was pissed on his behaviour of not respecting the decision i made and to not contact me anymore. He agreed then, but i had to be blunt so he could understand. 

Again month passes here i am contacting him casually. Friendly conversation. He is into it. We haven't seen each other since last year. 

I love this man, even though i wanted to cut all contact, never see him again. I can lie others, but i can't myself. I love him. 

I did the menstrual blood in his drink spell. I don't know if it will work. I want him to be happy, i never want to see him suffering or be unhappy. But i love him, honestly and with all my being. I am crazy for this man. 


The menstrual blood i poured in a drink, alcohol. But it was colorless so he noticed that the drink had changed colour, but nevertheless he drank from it. Not whole drink, but he did. Two cups, the first he drink it and didn't noticed nothing. 

If anyone is familiar, will this work, or come after me, i am crying all night long for what i did. And for him, because i love him. It sounds possessive, but its not obsession, i love him. There isn't anything i won't do for him, i would without a question give my life for him if i need to show that.

Help/Love Spells?,3,ftbisb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/ftbisb/helplove_spells/,0,1585813716.0,"So here is some background information.

On March 21st my ex and I reunited after close to two years of no contact. We had broken up and he had started a new relationship with someone who ended up being very physically, mentally, and emotionally manipulative. He had broken up with her the week before we reunited so it's fairly fresh. Up until this past Sunday things between him and I were great. We had confessed we still loved each other and that we had wanted to work towards something together again (this time with better communication, etc.)

Well, things changed. We still love each other, however, he wants to work on himself and remain single. He said that he had wanted to be single before our reuniting moment and just got caught up in ""it"" (us reconnecting) at the wrong time. I totally understand his decision.

So what I'm asking here is...is there a spell that I can perform to help him discover himself but still have an interest in rekindling a healthy and communicative romantic relationship?

"Here's a spell for academic success, y'all go forth and ace them online classes",51,fsft3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fsft3s/heres_a_spell_for_academic_success_yall_go_forth/,4,1585700222.0,"This is great on its own, but it's especially helped me during this time when school has switched online and we're all trying to adjust and cope. I thought I'd share with you guys!

What you need (but keep in mind ingredients are always adjustable if needed, due to availability or allergies):

Sunwater - For energy and motivation

Tea - To serve as your base. I used a cup of black tea for energy

Vanilla - Helps restore lost energy (You could even use vanilla tea)

Caraway - To enhance mental powers and memory

Rosemary - For good memory, clear thinking, concentration, and to repel negativity

Strawberry - To increase favorable circumstances, success, and good fortune


Using the sunwater, brew your tea and add the rest of the ingredients. I just opened the tea bag and poured in about half a teaspoon of dried rosemary and caraway seed to make straining easier, and added a piece of chopped strawberry to the water along with a couple of drops of vanilla extract. State the intent for each ingredient as you add them, and then let the tea steep. 

Once it's done, strain and add sugar if you want--sugar is used to attract in the same way that salt is used to banish--and stir clockwise as you charge it with your intent; you can be more broad or more narrow. For me it's ""I'll do great in all of my classes this semester"", and since that's quite broad, I'll probably be repeating this ritual regularly. But you could also do something like ""I'll ace that final exam"" or ""I'll make an A on that research paper"", etc. I also hold my hand over the cup and let the stream wet my fingers, which I then use to annoint myself on my forehead. This is a perfect spell to perform in the morning before you get to work, because of its energizing and motivating qualities :)",Spells

So back in the summer I did some spell work that I found out in January actually worked.

It is a x3 spell, so I know it’s an ongoing thing, but I feel that it’s so important to thank spirit. However, is it ever too late? In the sense that I should say thank you AND make an offering as an apology for taking so long to connect and show gratitude? 

I guess I’m asking if there is anything extra I can or should do to show my thanks and if it is necessary to show apologies by making offerings etc...",Spells

It’s hard to explain. They usually manifest exactly how the dream plays out but very rarely they’re more symbolic and make sense later. I can usually tell which is which but this time I’m stuck. I’m currently sat up in bed because I awoke from a prophetic dream (not sure whether symbolic or actual). In this dream, I was sat on my couch  with my mother, and I knew that someone was coming for me at 7:00pm, someone bad. I was doing normal stuff for a while like I was just okay? With the situation. I kept looking at a photograph of someone. Later on in the dream, I looked towards my phone and it said 7:09pm. I set everything I was holding down and just waited. A few moments later a man in a hoodie came around the corner and his face was initially obscured by a white light. 

Me and a friend have been seeing the same figure in dreams, who is pure white. In hers, he spoke and it sounded demonic to her and she ran. In mine, I was chasing him. I’m not sure if this is at all connected but I thought the white light was a fairly big coincidence to have. 

When he came around the corner the light slowly died off and I saw his face. I don’t recognise this man at all, and he was asking me about the person in the photograph, asking me where they were. I was calmly saying that the person was dead, incredibly calmly. Then, the man was crying and he started to hack at my hands, cutting them. I could feel the pain but I was still quite calm, and then I woke up. 

Not sure if real or symbolic but definitely prophetic. I’m not sure how to explain how I know, it’s just kind of like a dark sort of holographic overlay. But I know. 

Anyway, the reason this has freaked me out so much is because I and my family were robbed as a child and I woke up during to see five armed men in my living room. I was Christian back then, I’m not now but I had a dream about it weeks before it happened, and couldn’t accept that my dreams meant something at that time because of my religion. I didn’t believe in anything like this. That dream, though quite outlandish with the choices of weapons and what they said, was a ‘real’ dream. It happened exactly as I dreamt it. Now, I’m incredibly worried about this one. Can anyone recommend a relatively simple protection spell? I’m new to spell work but I need the piece of mind.

However me and said friend are not really in good terms anymore, it’s actually a complicated situation. So I don’t feel comfortable with that person having these personal stuff). I think that sigil magick is the way to go. Do you think that a sigil is the best approach here? Does anyone have something else to suggest or knows a spell for that purpose? Thanks to all!",Spells
Ritual of Self-Actualisation,12,fmai81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fmai81/ritual_of_selfactualisation/,2,1584799703.0,"RITUAL OF SEIZING THE MORN/RITUAL OF SELF-ACTUALISATION

This is a Ritual I have created and use daily, the Ritual took a little bit of structural inspiration from the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, however it must be made clear; 

	THIS IS NOT A BANISHING RITUAL. THIS IS NOT AN ADAPTATION OF THE LBRP, SIMILAR ONLY IN STRUCTURE. 

This Ritual is designed for daily use, its purpose is to 'Actualise' the self for the day, to realise and understand that you are part of nature, that you are of the Earth, and have a lot of potential. It is a ritual to be done daily, upon waking and bathing, it can be used as a confidence booster, a motivator, an invocation of energy, and awaking your own energy, power raising, and as intended; for Self Actualisation (realising the power you possess). A seizing the day ritual if you will. 

	Things needed:

	Something to represent the four elements, for e.g:

	1 bowl of water (Water - West) 

	1 stick of incense (Air - North) 

	1 bowl of salt or stones (Earth - East) 

	1 lit candle or dagger (South - Fire)

Now set up the elemental symbols on the floor in their respected positions. I am using a statue of a raven to represent the Air, and a plant to represent the Earth. Position them so that you are in between them, with enough space to move around.
Bathe and be present in clean clothes, or naked. Light the candle. 

Power Raising/Self-Actualization

Enter the space you have made with the symbols of the elements and face the East, in the direction of Earth. 

Touch your forhead with the index finger of your right hand and take a moment to calm the mind. Visualise stardust, the dust and rocks and atoms in space that formed the planets, and the stars, imagine this multicoloured crystal energy; this divine stardust forming everything; space, planets, galaxies, etc. Visualise this power forming the self, swirling around you (you as a person) and realise what you know to be true; that you are of the Earth. 

When the visualisation is strong, vibrate the words ""Alive"" and ""Awake"", do this in one breath for each word; like this:
	
	""AAAALLLLL - IIIIIIIIIVVVVE""

Next breath:

	""AAAAAAA - WAAAAAAAKE""

Now point your right hand to the sky and your left to the ground (similar to the symbolism of The Magician Tarot Card, of the Arthur Edward Waite Deck) and form that pose. Now visualise even more strongly this stardust, now it is coming from the ground into the left hand, and from the sky into the right hand, feel it. You are a catalyst of Magick, magick is you. Know again that you are of the Earth, a part of this world, a part of nature. 
Now vibrate these words while visualising: 

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""

Say it like this; 
	first breath equals 

	""IIIIIIIII - AMMMMM - OOONNNNNE"" 

Second breath equals

	""ONNNNNNNE - ISSSSS - MEEEEE"" 

Third beath equals

	""AALLLLLLL - ISSSSSSSSSS - ONNNNNNNNE"" 

What is being done here is what I like to call Self-Actualisation, also the visualisation is being vocalised; that the self (you) are the same divinity of the world around us, 'you' are one and one is all. Continue the visualisation of the Divine power moving through you, until you see it and feel it strongly. Know you are a part of nature, and of power.

Now, still facing East. Slash through the air like a knife of strong winds. And vibrate:

	""Mighty as wind"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""MIIIIIGHT - YYYYY - ASSSSS - WIIIIIIIIND"" 

Then say:

	""As strong as the hardest winds, but I am a gentle breeze"" 

Draw a pentegram with your hand in the air, within the pentegram, visualise the space and stars, and multicoloured crystal energies, the same space and stars from earlier. 
	
Now put the hands together in a prayer like position and visualise absorbing bright yellow energy coming from the depth of space. When satisfied with strong visualisation, Bow, then turn to the South. 

Facing South. Punch forward directly, like a directed flame. Vibrate:

	""Fierce as Flames"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""FIIIII - ERRRRRRRCE - ASSSSS - FLAAAAAAMMES"" 

Then say:

	""Fierce as a directed fire and warm as the brightest flame""

Repeat the pentegram, imagine the space, the Divine energies, space and stars flowing within and around, 
Hands as before, prayer like and visualise. This time the energy you are absorbing is bright red energies from inside the pentegram, from the vastness of space. Allow this red energy to fill you up. Bow, then turn towards the West. 

Facing West. Lift arm up, like throwing heavy waves. And vibrate:

	""Soul of the Waves"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""SOOOULLLLL - OFFFF - THEEEEE - WAVVVVVES"" 

Then say:

	""Mighty as the grandest wave and calming as the sea"" 

Again, repeat the pentegram and visualisation of deep space within it, the Magickal multi coloured crystal like energy. 
Now hands in prayer position again, visualise absorbing beautiful blue energies from the depth of space, from within the pentegram, allow this blue to fill you. Bow, and turn towards the North. 

Facing North. Tense the arm to symbolise the strength of the earth. Vibrate:

	""Steadfast as Earth"" 

Like this, one breath, 

	""STEEEAADD - FAAAST - ASSSSS - EARRRRRTH"" 

Then say:

	""Steadfast as Earth and the body of all life"" 

Again repeat the pentegram and visualisation of the Divine energy and space, hands in prayer position, visualise absorbing wondrous green energies this time, from the depth of space. 

Turn back towards the East. Visualise all the different colours and energies flowing all around you and through you. 
Again, repeat The Magician Pose and absorb all these energies, allow them to crash around you, into you, you are brimming with the power of the elements, now just like before, repeat these earlier vibrations:

	""I am one, one is me, all is one""
	(While in The Magician Pose) 

Then touch forhead and vibrate:

	""Alive"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

	""Awake"" (one breath as it was earlier) 

Stomp right foot or ring a bell to conclude. 

You are now self actualized and ready for all, aware of the power you possess. 

	NOTE: ALL PENTAGRAMS DRAWN SHOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR, BE IT A BEAUTIFUL BLUE OR BLINDING WHITE. THEY ARE INVOKING PENTAGRAMS.

Spell worked!,40,fk1w02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fk1w02/spell_worked/,10,1584463587.0,"So, at first I thought that I was doing something wrong, but it looks like the spell worked. It was a spell to make a specific person to notice my qualities, and I think it worked! He started calling me every day, and we talk for like an hour. Since in Italy nobody can go out, we facetime and we call each other. We use WhatsApp too. And he lives in front of my house. I really like where this is going! YAY! 
Edit: someone asked me to share the spell, so here it is! First, light a candle. Then, bring that candle in your bathroom and have a purifying bath. Keep the candle near you for about one and an half hour after the bath. Then, place your candle in your altar, and write on a little piece of paper what you want from that spell. I wrote: ""when this candle will burn down, (his name) will start seeing my qualities and my inner and outer beauty and my personality."" I folded the piece of paper, and I put it in the melting wax. You can burn it in the candle's flame, but since the spell will start when the candle burns down, the piece of paper will follow the candle burning. And that's it, let the candle burn down and keep the container, so the spell's energy will remain in your room. This started working the same day the candle consumed itself. You will notice a big change on how person acts towards you! ♡",Spells
Is there such a thing as a skeptic Witch/how do you usually go about developing your spells?,22,fjwcmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjwcmb/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_skeptic_witchhow_do/,10,1584436329.0,"So, for a bit of context, I personally don't believe in magic yet. I respect those who practice it, and the lore of it is fascinating. At the same time, I prefer to use spells as a mental tool; a ritual can give me a boost to concentration or resolve, regardless of whether it's really magic.

Which brings me to a question: can you be a Witch who doesn't believe in magic? A short spell can do you good purely for mental reasons, and traditional remedies toe the line between alchemy and Science.


On completely unrelated note (I didn't want to double-post), how do *you*, personally, develop or discover spells? Do you wait for an idea to come to you, do you structure it from elements (I.e. Arcana, stones, ingredients) relating to the effect? I'm curious to see how people go about the process.",Spells

"Energy Work to help you in the COVID ""panic""",40,fjl6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fjl6pq/energy_work_to_help_you_in_the_covid_panic/,0,1584395147.0,"An ER nurse in the r/energy_work forum asked what she can do to help deal with both the medical dangers, but also the dark and panicky energy she's surrounded by during the COVID pandemic. I wanted to share my ideas here too, in case any of you are worried or affected.  


\*\*\*  
If you can wear a quartz crystal then put it into a bowl of salt every time you go home and take it off, that will help. You can also wear hematite, tiger eye, sunstone, and obsidian. I know  that a necklace may not be allowed in the ER but even an ankle bracelet would help. Just have the stones on your person somewhere. All those stones do well to absorb negativity. To add in positive mood energy, wear or carry amethyst and rose quartz.

Next, I know you won't want to wear TOO much perfume, but if you can put some lavender oil, calendula (marigold) oil, and citrus essential oil on your pulse points, that would help.Consider dressing your helper stones and crystal with that oil as well.

On your break, go outside if you can and put your back against a stone or tree. Even a stone or brick wall can help. Feel yourself ""melting"" into the tree or stone. Feel the calm stable strength of it. Let energy reach down into the earth along with the tree roots or the foundation of the wall or stone. Let your energy extend up out of your fingertips like branches. To an outsider it will just look like you raise up your arms and have a good stretch so don't be embarrassed what others may think.Take a deep breath in through your nose and just push/dump/drain all the energy in your body down through your feet into the ground. Then take another breath and breathe in fresh energy, pulling it down from the sky and the clouds and the air. Do that 3 times total. If you know how to shield, then finish by putting your auric shields back up.

The next thing I do is sit in a few minutes of meditation while charging my stones and magickal tools. I imagine a roaring hot campfire, too hot to sit next to. I feel the heat on my face and hands, I see the flickering light. I hear the wood popping and snapping in the flames and the rush of the hot air rising, the low roar of the fire. I try to smell the good spicy musky woodsmoke scent.

It's ok to use a candle, a fireplace, or just a video of a campfire, to help visualize. Then I imagine myself being hollow and light, as if my bones were hollow conduits. And I ""reach out"" energetically and pull that campfire into me. As if my belly was the fireplace and my chest and throat and head were the chimney. I sit there for a few minutes and try to become fire. 

This is AMAZING for your immune system. I have a stage IV terminal cancer and after multiple rounds of chemo my oncologist keeps saying ""I have no idea how your white blood cell count and platelets and hematocrit look this good with the chemo cocktail you are on, but whatever you're doing just keep doing it.""  


A similar meditation is to lie looking up into the starry night sky and feel yourself drifting up into it. Drift among the stars, then drift over to one. Feel the incredible power of the giant furnace of the star, then pull it into yourself and have a hot yellow-white sun burning inside your 3rd chakra, in your belly. You can even do a galaxy! That's less good for immune system, but good for protection, and great for grabbing a huge pile of energy to use to create a reality or heal others.   


Using the same technique, toss a mint bath bomb down in your shower and stand under the coolest temperature water that still feels good. Become waterfall. Become crashing waves. This is good for clearing out emotional energy that doesn't belong to you.  


All day at work, every time things get crazy, take one second to just \*feel\* that fire in your lower chakras roar up, like throwing a log on a campfire.

Learn the Cho Ku Rei symbol. Pull a ball of that fire energy into your hand and sneakily draw the symbol on anything that needs some darn powerful healing, fast. You can also google and learn the Se He Ki symbol and draw it anytime you feel in danger or on anything that seems to need protection. You don't need to be attuned to Reiki energy in order to use those symbols - they work fine to direct ANY healing energy.

Consider hopping into r/ReikiPractitioners and asking if you could be given Reiki attunements. It CAN be done even from a distance on a video call, in some traditions. Energy healing disregards physical distance in many ways. Reiki could do a lot to protect you, and also to save patients that might otherwise not do as well. I like to think of Reiki as that one small weight on the scale to tip the balance - if you're kinda getting sick, but your immune system is also kinda fighting it off, Reiki is SO GOOD at giving things that little ""shove"" so you fight off a cold instead of catching it.  And similar situations. If a person is in the balance, and they 50/50 might make it, or might not, Reiki is the energy work ""tool"" needed there IMO.",Spells

What do do when feeling irritable and drained?,26,fhqqsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fhqqsc/what_do_do_when_feeling_irritable_and_drained/,2,1584087967.0,"Someone in my energy work & reiki subreddit asked this question; what can you do with magic and energy work, when you feel drained and irritable all the time - how can you use energy to help with that?  


 I wanted to share my answer here too since I think it's a good question - and hopefully you guys will share ideas so I can pass them on to my friends over at r/energy_work

\*\*\*  


Go outside and stand with your back against a tree, and with your energy, copy what the tree's energy is doing. If you don't sense energy at that detailed level yet, visualize that the bark is melting and letting you melt into the tree trunk. Feel your toes dig into the dirt like roots, imagine white root-shaped lines of energy sinking down into the dirt. Raise your arms and stretch up, feel your fingers extend into long branched green tendrils of energy.

Also be aware that just like physical irritation, emotional irritation is a sign that something in your environment is being unhealthy and toxic. If you kept breaking out in a weird rash, you hopefully would not ignore it! You'd go searching for the cause, then get it out of your diet or body or environment. Same with mental/emotional irritation.

It's often overwork and burnout - but putting up with energy vampire type people is a common trigger too. Energy vamp types don't always make you feel BAD - heck, they can be really exciting fun people, just very draining and tiring if you have to deal with them for hours/days. A narcissist in your life can be worse than an actual energy vamp, so [r/narcissism](https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/) or similar subreddit might be a place to check and see if you know anyone like that.

If you just cannot get rid of the cause, because it's a person who is too deeply part of your life, then there's things you can do. Shield, shield, shield. Learn to make yourself the energy equivalent of a tank :) Plenty of how-to's out there on that, so I won't duplicate it here. 

Also, grounding. Learn to ground so deep that you feel a hurricane would just make you sway a bit. Again, it's not the method you use, it's how much and how often you practice. Every spare moment. A martial arts teacher once told me ""if you're waiting in line, waiting in a lobby, wherever, you get your feet into one of the stances you've been taught, and practice moving forward correctly in that stance as the line moves up. It can be waiting time, or free practice time; your choice."" 

When shielding, centering, grounding, and raising energy is what you're constantly practicing, it's also helping you feel better on many levels. Plus, practicing it in odd locations means if you ever need to use it in a really sketchy or scary situation, you're used to being in public and around others, so it won't distract you.

Every time you're bored in a waiting room or a line, this is time to practice energy work drills. I've met some friends at festivals and events that way too. ""I promise I'm not on drugs, I just wanna ask, why are you doing that with your aura?"" Is one of the most memorable ways anyone has ever introduced themselves to me :)

Another spell I like to do is ""gifting"" - every emotion and energy is useful somewhere, sometime, to someone. So, I like to make a glyph or rune that represents my ""unwanted"" emotion, then infuse that glyph with a big ol ball of my emotion and offer it up to the universe as a gift to anyone who currently needs that emotion. I watch it drift away like a soap bubble and I try to imagine a situation where that emotion would be helpful and healing to someone. Even feeling irritable as heck... well, somewhere, there's a person with saint-like patience being taken advantage of by a lazy spouse, for example. It would do them \*good\* to get fed up and give the lazy one an real earful, for once.

If nothing else, doing that energy work and visualization helps me make peace with the emotion - sometimes even decide ""Hey, I kinda wanna keep it, and let it actually \*do\* it's job in my life right now.""",Spells

Why is real life sorcery so boring compared to D and D and Harry Potter divine powers found in fiction? Why doesn't real life have magick that allows Force Lightning in Star Wars or Charmed's Piper Freeze Time Ability?,2,fdz0wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/fdz0wv/why_is_real_life_sorcery_so_boring_compared_to_d/,6,1583459455.0,"Saw this conversation on Discord.

>While we are at it, a question I've had with TechEmporium. An exact message I sent on a few discord rooms.
>
A frequent point me a TechEmporiun frequently discuss is......... If Magick is real why don't we see fireballs being shot out of people's hands? Or people chanting a name and an earthquake happens?

>This is proof of mass hysteria according to scientiffic magician and he says all occultists and even Christians from Linah at NightHouse to Geno at Occult and Chill to RCR917 and Bassackwards all are buying into.

>There is no ""harry potter"" magick where you wave a wand around and suddenly you create a ray of light that can burn someone according to atheist magician.
Even when people describe incidents where magical stuff appear, nothing is anywhere close to say Super Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z destroying buildings because they shoot out energy blasts or Kenpachi cutting a skyscraper in half with a single sword swing or FOrce Lightning style attacks where electricity literally comes out of your finger tips like Emperor Palpatine.

>Its more boring mundane magick by fictional standards like flying hammers and such. Even by something as more low level and earthly as Charmed, the magic supposed veterans like Xaithu, RCR917, Geno, and Monster at the NIghthouse Discord room encounter is low level like a ceiling collapsing. Not freezing time like Piper could and Force telekenesis liek Prue could or seeing distant future visions like Phoebe could. Nothing that Charmed Halliwell's sister at all.

>I have to ask why even the real magickal stuff is nothing like Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons?
Its for this reason why TechEmporium says all magick is BS and its all just altering your brain's chemical function. He says if D and D magick was real like Zeus throwing lightning, how supposed apparitions like Zeus doesn't shock his opponent with force lightning? Or supposed appearance of Santa Muerte causes instant death to people who anger her in summoning by a black aura spreading in a room like a horror movie?
I'm just so curious how claims like reading minds Jean Grey style or faster than light speed common in anime/manga fights come from? Why mythology is full of them and even the Abrhaamic religionst oo? Yet from people interactions with the gods and demons and whatever the real story is far more boring?

>Can humans actually learn how to control a river to do whipping attacks using water like in some fantasy Wuxia martial arts films and make the earth shake by stomping their foot on the ground and cracking the floor in front of you split wide open like Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender can do? And other D and D style magick?If so how come no occultists have done so in modern times?

I am quite curious why real life magick is so boring and seems to work more by coincidences and laws of science? None of that shooting ray of destructive light out of your finger tip like in YuYu Hakusho and other stuff the Discorder stated in the quote above? Why is it just boring candles that simply tips the balance in say business dealings or subconsciously changes your habit through placebo effect and accessing psychological archetypes?

Even the cases we have of demonic attachment and stuff and defying the science, the magick is so low level like causing a keychain to levitate. We don't have stuff that is close to fictional powerful like Prue waving her arms and destroying an entire room in Charmed or Gandalf using his staff to bring out a sphere of light that blinds an entire battalion of American marines for over 10 minutes! The stuff we have is mostly boring low stuff like bleeding out of nowhere when meeting an angel or someone being lifted midair by an angry spirit. Or feeling the energy of a person (but not necessarily reading his thoughts like Jean Grey in X-Men could).

Rejuvenation potion- perfect for new beginnings. 

First you need moon water charged by a waxing crescent moon for inspiration and hope. If there won’t be a waxing crescent for a few weeks use sun water instead. 
Next is bergamot oil for invigoration.
Finally, citrine for regeneration and intuition. 

First, take a cleansed crystal and hold it in your hands; channel all your positive energy and hope into the crystal. Next, I charged my moon water with a citrine crystal in the bowl. If you’re charging your water with the sun then don’t add citrine yet as the light can degrade the crystal, add the crystal to the sun water for a few hours out of direct sunlight. Remove the citrine, a few drops of bergamot oil to the water and tip it into a glass bottle (ideally with a cork). To make it look prettier I added fresh herbs to the bottle, rosemary for purification and thyme for luck. 

To use the potion I took it outside and found a sunny spot- this can be the grass, soil or even concrete. Even if it’s a dull day try to find a few moments of sunlight for the spell. Pour the potion (all of it or just a little) in a circle and sit inside it, I sat cross legged on the floor but grab a seat if you need one. Bask in the light for as long as you want to (or as long as you can if the sun hides away), I stayed for about half an hour and meditated. 

That’s it! Hope you enjoyed this and got some inspiration. How else would you use this potion? How would you change it?",Spells

I pick up my glass and before I can even take a sip, I look down at my glass and see a curled up dead spider floating inside my succulent beverage. I was literally baffled. Beyond confused. 
I’m a practicing witch how has very long hereditary lines. I know a lot about witchcraft, occult, spells ect... but this I haven’t come across and if I did, I don’t remember this.

1. A Mp3 player and some earbuds
With sd technology the way it is you can easily fit close to 24 hours of songs into less than an ounce of pack weight. Theres nothing like the sweet sound of sea shanties to make the long march seem a little less long

2. Drink Mix Flavor Bombs, (Credit to Scoutmaster Sam for this one Take your favorite drink mix, measure out an appropriate amount for your water container, put it in a sandwich bag, tie it closed, cut off excess  bag.  To use, pinch/twist off the corner and add to your drink. It makes you more likely to drink and it allows you to get calories from your beverage. 

3. Cards
You can play a surprising amount of games of solitaire before you get bored. If you’re lost with a buddy then your entertainment options are limitless.

4. Caffeine Pills
Lightweight and some of the stronger varieties can probably wake the dead. Will keep you trudging. 

5. The classic kindle Ereader
Weighing at a whopping 6.7 ounces a properly stocked ereader can provide limitless entertainment and can hold charge for upwards of a month of continuous use.

1. Why doesn't the cougar back off after a minute or two? It seems not worth it food-to-energy wise, and takes 3x as long.

2) Is there anything he could have done to scare it off faster? Would throwing rocks, stopping in his tracks and stomping a foot, or yelling louder done anything, or just aggravated it?

I'm hoping someone can help me with a book suggestion (or other resource suggestion) for foraging in east Texas. 

Some background: My family owns a fair bit of property about an hour north of Houston. It's heavily wooded, full of pine, ash, elm, oak, yaupon, and a variety of other trees and bushes. I've already identified a fair number of edible foragibles, but I want to up my game from amateur to competent. 

There's a lot of research out there and sometimes it's a bit conflicting. Also, the easy stuff like greenbrier is commonly mentioned, but some of the more obscure foragibles are harder to learn about. Does anyone have suggestions on a comprehensive guidebook that will focus on my region's biodiversity? I'm also looking for suggestions on edible mycology (mushroom hunting) books.

I keep 4 in my BOB. 

I have used these in the wild, and they are supremely easy. First, find a rabbit or animal run that looks well used, and locate a small tree or solid bush next to it. Thread the bare end of the guitar string through the ball end, like threading a needle, forming the snare loop. Firmly attach the bare end of the string to the anchor point, so that the snare loop is about 10"" wide and hanging in the run. Check your snares at least once daily, up to three times if you can. The wire will securely trap the animal, and often strangle it if it gets around their neck.

I was attacked by a raccoon,25,j2eow0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/j2eow0/i_was_attacked_by_a_raccoon/,38,1601466023.0,"This might seem dramatic compared to other survival situations but I can’t get help anywhere. I was attacked by a raccoon 

This sounds ridiculous I know but help me out here haha 

So my apartment complex has been overrun with raccoons for a long time now. It’s a pretty nice complex and I pay a lot for rent. They used to put a ladder in the dumpster everyday for raccoons to crawl out of because they would accidentally pick up like 10 raccoons in the garbage truck. It’s right next to a park and creek so it’s a good spot for them to live and snag some food. They aren’t really scared of people which is fine because they usually keep to themselves. I have never had a problem with them. They grab their trash and go. 

There is a little hole in the chain link fence that leads to the park right down the side walk of my apartment. Last night I was taking my two dogs out (big dogs-border collie/Aussie) and some ran ahead of us from the parking lot and through the hole. 
One of my dogs barked so I paused and once the raccoons were through the hole I kept walking. One of the raccoons ran back through the hole after he was already a bit away and literally charged us. One of my dogs was snapping and barking so aggressively but the raccoon was not even a little bit phased. I started backing up to give it space and get my dogs away but it would not stop coming. It was hissing and making a really loud noise. My dogs were freaking out and I started retreating as fast as I could while getting my dogs under control and keeping an eye on it. 

My dogs are up to date on rabies but I didn’t want to take chances. I started running and I was screaming a bit. It wasn’t the raccoon itself but they carry very deadly diseases. It chased me a really long ways. People came out to their balcony because of the commotion and were yelling. The raccoon was sticking to the fence which is covered in a thick bushy vine and would randomly jump out and try to bite. It chased me all the way to the base of my stairs until I was up the first flight (it was a really long distance). 

When I got to the top where the staircase is open the people on the balconies were talking to me and my friend who had watched the whole thing go down from my balcony. She said that everyone thought it was a mountain lion because it was hissing so loud and was banging through the vine against the fence so it seemed bigger than it was. 
I felt so silly but everyone said it was really terrifying to watch. 

I thought it had to be diseased because it chased me such a far distance and so aggressively. It was not trapped in a corner and it wasn’t defensive it was literally on the offense. 

I called my apartment complex the next morning because I didn’t want it to happen to anyone else and they seemed to take me seriously and told me they would look into the fence. They asked me to call animal control and have AC call them. 
So I did but AC said they can’t do anything until it bites someone. They said they weren’t going to go around banging bushes to find it and testing them for rabies was a really long process. He said raccoons in the area just aren’t scared of people and I probably got near it’s territory (it’s the sidewalk of my apartment so the raccoons shouldn’t have territory there??) 

I called the apartment complex back and told them what AC said and I asked them if they wanted me to send them a picture of the hole because it’s hard to find or if I could show it to them in person. 
She got really condescending and started calling me “sweetie” (I am a 25yr old woman so that was offensive to be talked to as a child and not get the respect of a resident) she said she would go find the hole later but they would have to find a way to secure a chain link fence and the raccoons could climb over it anyways. I said that I understood that but maybe getting rid of the easy access would discourage them from being directly in that area. 

I now hate the raccoons in the area which is fair and I don’t want someone to get bit before they take action (what if a child got bit?). Either way no one is going to do anything at this point. 

I still have to take my dogs out at night. I would never suggest a gun and I’m scared if I used pepper spray it would just blow in me or my dog’s faces and then we wouldn’t be able  to see to get away from the raccoon. 

They are small and I know my dogs could easily fight it and I could too probably but I would get scratched and bit if I tried to kick it or something. I’m not trying to get me or my dogs bit because they are such high carriers of disease. 

it’s so silly to be scared of such a small cute animal but the potential for deadly diseases is serious when they are attacking. 
They are not scare of noises or stomping or movement. 

Does anyone have any advice on a weapon to use in defense against a raccoon when I take my dogs out at night? 😂",Survival

It doesn't seem to be explicitly against the rules but...\*shug\*

I am looking to get a better understanding of non-region specific game types that can realistically be caught with traps. I tried Googling it and I got some good info, but mostly I was digging through PETA and Animal Rights pages that overwhelmed the search. I figured this subreddit would be a good place to get some insight from real people who know what they are talking about.

My players in D&D have found that they love trapping game (and hunting/fishing) while traveling. They set their traps at night and check them in the morning, the result of the trap is based on their ""Survival"" skill. Currently we are one session in, and I've been winging it with generalizations depending on their rolls ""You caught nothing"", ""You caught a squirrel/hare"", ""You caught a boar/deer"", ""You caught a bear"" (In a very rare instance).

I'd like to make this somewhat more realistic. I realize that D&D can never be realistic, especially in that there is just a generic ""Hunting Trap"" rather than something appropriately sized and baited for the specific game. I'm looking to get a handle on animals that can realistically be caught in a trap.

These are land traps, essentially a Jaw Trap.

So far I have:

Small Game

* squirrel
* rabbit/hare
* rat
* pheasant
* quail
* grouse
* partridge
* pheasant
* duck
* groundhog
* skunk
* bobcat
* weasel
* badger
* porcupine

Medium Game

* fox
* lynx
* beaver
* otter
* wombat
* dingo
* turkey
* goose
* monitor

Large Game

* boar
* goat
* sheep
* deer
* Ostrich/Moa
* Emu
* bison

Special Game (turns into a fight)

* kangaroo
* bear
* moose (??)
* wolf
* panther/cougar/mt. lion
* (Some kind of predatory bird)

I'd like to fill out these lists a bit more with real possibilities, such as Is a moose even logical? Region doesn't matter I can do that on my end.

I think wel all need to see this as a reminder that Knowledge > Tools.,17,iy9qcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iy9qcz/i_think_wel_all_need_to_see_this_as_a_reminder/,3,1600895220.0,"I'm talking about [these 3 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBVieA9ifLc&list=PLwEYCMnBm-lL6oyu528svgHxa0JUnzLE0) by YouTuber Vinniesdayoff that demonstrate using a crappy non-locking folding knife as a survival knife. 

I found this a couple of months ago, and it opened my eyes. I'm an owner of a Fallkniven A1 and S1 knives. Bought mostly with the idea that a strong reliable knife is the way to gon, but if you understand your tools and know a handful of skills even the crappiest of knives can get you a long way. Since then I've been using a Swiss Army Knife (Alox Farmer X) more and more as a way of practice my skills and I must say, it changed my philosophy thoroughly when it comes to wood processing tools.

Now I'm not saying you should all replace your fixed blade knife in your kit with a SAK. But if you consider buying/selecting a knife for your kit, maybe consider a smaller option. When it comes to a survival kit, weight is always a big concern. Besides that, smaller blades are better suited for finer task and these finer tasks can also be very important in a survival situation. 

Most of all, practice with different tools for the job. Know what to do when you don't have the ideal tool at hand, learn how to split wood without batoning on your blade or without an axe, and learn how to properly use folding knives where you're at. 

It's a good ideology in general when it comes to honing outdoor skills, not just knives.

I only own 2 Gerbers (Gator 1and Warrant) and this would be my first 'expensive' knive. I came across ESEE and the model 4 seems to fulfill my expectations in terms of blade size and durability, however there are still some issues I need someones opinion on:

\- Handle size. Apparently the handle is too small? I don't have particularly large hands for a man, I'd say about average (glove size about 10) but still...

\- Sheath. From what I can see the sheath does not provide a locking mechanism for the knive to not fall out unless it is some sort of clipping mechanism inside the sheath? Does anyone have any experience here?

\- Steel. Most of their models are using the 1095 which apparently makes them extremely durable but you will have to care for it more (grease the blade to prevent corrosion). They do have a 440C version of the ESEE but they state in their warranty explanation that this one will not be as durable. I am leaning towards the 1095 but in almost every forum I visited people recommend not getting a 1095 blade in favour of a 440C one. So yeah, any thoughts on that?

Review of Multiple Fire Sources,12,ix2fpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ix2fpz/review_of_multiple_fire_sources/,6,1600730409.0,"Hello reddit, the objective of buying multiple fire starting tools is to prevent the risk of being unable to start a fire due to damage or depleted resources.

I bought a variety of fire starting products on 9/20/2020, windy, with a temperature range of 43 F to 63 F, depending on the time of day. All product links meet Grade A or Grade B of the FakeSpot Rating System, and hold 4.5 to 5 stars.

Classic Bic Lighter ($10.49) Bic lighters will almost always work, but if it is cold, you will have to warm it up with your hands. Classic Bic Lighters hold an hour worth of fuel. If you do the math, 60 Minutes X 60 Seconds, you get 3600 seconds. If you get a fire in a maximum of 10 seconds for all fire attempts, that is 360 fires per Classic Bic Lighter, or 7.89 Years (8 lighters X 360 days = 2880 days, 2880 days / 365 days = 7.89 years)

Pros:

Reliable fire source due to the flame

Fast fire starting due to the flame

The flint can be used after empty fuel

Cons:

Short Usage Period for each bic lighter

Possible leakage of fluid over time

Possible cracking during direct impact

Possible Explosions during high heat

Not Waterproof

Not Water Resistant

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Ferro Rod 1.5 x 6 inches ($14.99) This is the only product I have not bought, but due to its popularity, I did my research on the product to find the best brand and product.

To be speak safely, one ferro rod will provide 10,000 sparks. If it takes a maximum of 10 strikes to start a fire, you will have 1,000 fires, or 2,000 fires if 5 strikes is attempted. This is 1,000 to 2,000 fires per rod. 1,000 fires / 365 = 2.75 Years per rod or 2,000 fires / 365 = 5.5 Years per rod. Since there is two rods in the link listed below, that is 5.5 years if each rod provides 2.75 years (1,000 fires per rod), or 11 years if each rod provides 5.5 years (2,000 fires per rod).

Pros:

Reliable due to amount and temperature of sparks

Impact Resistant due to the metal strength

Waterproof since it is only a metal

Water resistant since it is only a metal

Cons:

Expensive as a longterm source of fire

Pocket Size Fresnal Lens ($4.75) Surprisingly, the pocket size fresnal lens started a fire with a piece of charcloth in under 10 seconds, even during the cold and windy day. Fresnal Lens should last forever if scratches are prevented, since plastic decays after a several thousand years. Within the link listed below, each fresnal lens comes in individual sleeves, which are collectively within a larger thick clear pouch. Therefore, the only way to deeply scratch these lens is by taking the fresnal lens out of the individual sleeves.

Pros:

Can be used to alert passing air vehicles with the focal light

Can be used to magnifying words for reading

Lasts forever if properly used

Reliable if it is sunny

Somewhat impact resistant

Water resistant

Waterproof

Cons:

Not reliable if it is cloudy

Can scratch easily making it unusable

Fire Piston ($24.75) This product is great, and will ignite charcloth using only air! The inside is metal within both pieces, so even if the wood decays during a second lifetime, it will still work! All you have to do is remove the o-ring during non-usage, and apply lubrication during each usage to extend the o-ring life to 5 years each. I bought a bag of the correct sized o-rings, containing 100 pieces for about 6-7 dollars on amazon. So in other words, with proper care from rusting, the product could last for 500 years! Remember to use spit to lubricate!

Pros: Lasts almost forever due to wood protection

Only requires air and charcloth to start a fire

Water resistant

Cons:

Possible rusting if unproperly used

Steel Striker for Flint with Bow-Drill Hole ($27.82) This is a very hard tool, and I do not recommend it for beginners. I was unable to start a fire with a rock which gave sparks. This was not possible with flammable substance or charcloth. I have not used the bowdrill, due to the time requirements of using a bow-drill. However, this striker will last a very long time since steel does not erode very easily.

Pros: Can find flint anywhere to be used for the striker

Common stick can be used for the bow-drill hole

Lasts as long as the steel

doesnt erode

Impact resistant

Cons:

Time Consuming

Blisters on your hands

Fire is not likely guaranteed

Replacing old US Navy mummy bag. Need some advice in an unfamiliar brand.,1,iwvaee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iwvaee/replacing_old_us_navy_mummy_bag_need_some_advice/,2,1600699654.0,"TLDR: replacing old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. New target for a nearly year round bang is the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". I know next to nothing about Slumberjack and would love to hear if any one has experience with this specific sleeping bag or one that has the same qualities.

I'm looking to replace my old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. I acquired it in my early teen years and have been stubbornly using it as my go-to sleeping bag for any and all occasion for the past 13-14 years. Whether it be late fall car camping in pretty low temps to backpacking 5-8 miles to the campsite in August... I live in Utah for reference.

Don't get me wrong, I adore this bag and it has held up beyond my wildest expectations. I have never felt too cold while in it, even to the point of sweating when it's snowing outside the tent. It still looks nearly untouched after some rough bush over the past decade. It only learned the pleasure of a protective compression sack this year and still the only sign that it's been used and abused is the ""US NAVY"" on the underside is nearly faded away.

My only gripe is, if my scale is accurate, packed up it weighs just over 13 pounds. That's a lot of weight to be strapped to the bottom of my Mardingtop 65+10L pack going up mountains in 90-100 degree weather. The cold nights where I sit in my tent with my dog bundled up grinning a snarky grin, knowing I'm the most comfy person at the site are no longer worth hauling that mattress around.

After spending most of the day going through any market place I could find online, I believe I have found the bag that match's what I'm wanting nearly exactly. It's still on the heavier side, but cuts down the weight more then half. Also, after using the Navy bag for so long I have grown accustomed to being in my ""nest"" as I'm fond of calling it. 
Only thing that sucks, I have no knowledge or experience with the brand so I'm hesitant to pull the trigger with it sounding to good to be true.

It's the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". Looks to only be sold first hand on their offical website and one of the local Walmarts near me. It hits nearly all of my criteria perfectly, but that's all just from the details on the webpage that seem to very depending on who's selling and where. Seen to many adds boast a total weight only to see the actual weight being a few pounds more or less. 

The few reviews their are don't really hit the points I'm wanting to know and there are no youtube reviews on it at all. If anyone has used this specific sleeping bag or know of any that align with it and are even less weight, I would love to hear about it!

"Inexpensive, shelf-stable lip balm formula",132,ivixhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ivixhj/inexpensive_shelfstable_lip_balm_formula/,38,1600507178.0,"With colder weather approaching, I have finally got around to a project that I have been meaning to do for years.

There are a lot of home-made lip balm formulas online, but they weren't really what I was looking for.

While they are no doubt just as effective as the store bought stuff, the disadvantage is that they have a limited shelf life.

I wanted to come up with a lip balm base that can be made in bulk and stored pretty much indefinitely.

I began by using formulas available online but substituting perishable ingredients (such as coconut oil) with non-perishable ones.

After some experimentation, I have finally come up with something that I believe is about equal to store bought lip balm sticks, and won't go rancid like the homemade stuff.

As a bonus, the ingredients are simple, cheap, and available pretty much anywhere. Making the stuff is really simple too.

This makes a plain white lip balm base that has no taste or odor. Colors and flavors can be added, but this may decrease the shelf life.

While I was not deliberately aiming for a vegan formulation, it just so happens that none of the ingredients are animal in origin.

Ingredients:

Paraffin wax (sold in supermarkets as canning wax)

Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, though the generic ones are fine)

Mineral oil USP (in the laxative section of the pharmacy)

The formula is 1 part wax, 2 parts petroleum jelly, 3 parts mineral oil measured by weight.

Put the ingredients in a pan and **slowly** warm it on a low heat until it *just* melts. This is the trickiest part. Be careful not to overheat the mixture.

When it is all melted, stir well and pour into a suitable container such as a canning jar for storage.

This is your bulk supply. When you want to use some,  scoop a portion out with a spoon and re-melt it.

The consistency is perfect for filling empty lip balm tubes or small cosmetic pots, which can be bought on Amazon or from most craft stores.

If you want to make a more luxurious version, substitute beeswax instead of paraffin wax.",Survival

Emergency Flint & Steel Fire when you have no flint and no steel.,49,iuflr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/iuflr8/emergency_flint_steel_fire_when_you_have_no_flint/,16,1600361032.0,"If you don't have a purpose-built steel striker, many other things will work.  Do you have something else that is carbon steel?  Or can you find an old tool in a cellar hole or dump?  Can you salvage a part from a junk car or atv wreck?  Keep an eye out as you walk along the trail for a piece of metal.  But it has to be carbon steel-  not stainless steel, and not soft steel like the typical nail, sheet metal, angle iron, etc.

Is your knife carbon steel?  If not, then what about your ax?  If you're not sure then hit it with a hard rock.

What rocks are available in the area?  Flint or chert is good, if you can find it.  Quartz will also work, along with many other rocks.  Basalt can work if you knap a sharp edge on it.  Granite can work because it has quartz in it.  If you're not a geologist, don't worry.  You don't have to be an expert at identifying rocks.  You just have to locate a hard rock, not one one that is soft or crumbles easily.  Then hit it with your piece of steel.  If you see sparks, you are good to go.  Some steels are better than others for this purpose as are some rocks.  So with a good kit you could be getting gobs of fat sparks.  If your improvised kit is only throwing a few, wimpy sparks, that's ok.  It will likely take a little longer for a spark to hit your tinder and catch, but you can make it happen.  Just keep trying.

What kind of metal objects might work?  We already mentioned axes and knives.  And it's not just fixed blade knives.  Many antique and vintage pocket knives are carbon steel and throw wonderful sparks.  Learn how to identify the satisfying grey of old carbon tool steel.  If you are carrying an ax, you likely have a file to sharpen it.  Most files make great steel strikers.  Chisels often work well.  Hammers can throw sparks.  You should know that many tools are deferentially heat treated.  That means one area is harder than another part of the tool.  The hammer head's striking surface might throw sparks, but not the top.  The file's side might spark, but not the handle.  Pliers and wire cutters can throw sparks and also saw blades and many other tools.  Car parts, motorcycle parts, and other machine components are something to check.  Not everything will work, but you only have to find one thing that does.  Understand that you should clean grease and remove paint and rust from the striking area.  The cleaner it is, the better it will work.

It helps to practice with found rocks in your area, and also with various metal objects.  If you are poor, or unable to source a professionally-made steel striker in your area, you can make your own flint & steel kit.  Simply cut up, or break down the metal object to the size you want.  Find a rock, and knap a sharp edge.  Find some sort of metal tin for charring cloth, punk wood, fungus, and other things.  You're good to go.

I’m insanely anxious and I always overthink my safety, so I’m sharing with you guys the list of techniques I’ve made to avoid and/or survive attacks by some wild animals that we have here in the PNW.


COUGARS/MOUNTAIN LIONS-

If approached- Do NOT run. Do not turn your back to them, they are ambush predators. Make yourself look bigger to appear threatening. Maintain constant eye contact as you yell, make loud noises, and wave your arms about. Try to scare them off. Again, do NOT run as they will most likely attack.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. Try to remain on your feet and protect your head and neck. Fight back by any means possible. This means punching, kicking, any weapons you may have or nearby objects that can be used as a weapon.


BLACK BEARS-

If you see a black bear, respect its space. They will usually avoid you in turn as they are fairly timid. If you must pass them, give them a wide berth. They would rather flee than fight.

If approached- If you have children in your party, keep them close. Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand and face the bear directly. Speak calmly to identify yourself as something that is not a prey animal. If that does not work, make yourself look larger, and make loud noises to scare the bear away. Avoid direct eye contact.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. If you can escape to a safe location like a car or house, do it, but if not, then fight back. Black bears will not leave you alone if you play dead. Concentrate kicks and blows to the bear’s face and snout.


GRIZZLY BEARS-

If you see cubs, slowly back away. They are cute and may actually be intrigued by you, but do not interact since mama bear is probably close by and will certainly kick your ass. 

If approached- Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand tall and make yourself look large. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it is most likely just curiosity. Slowly back away with your bear spray in your hand. Ideal spraying distance is 40-50 feet.

If attacked- Lay down and do NOT fight back. This will intensify the attack as the bear is usually trying to neutralize you as a threat. Assume a fetal position, protecting your stomach with your knees, and lace your fingers behind your neck to protect it. If the bear stops attacking, stay “dead” for at least 15-20 minutes because it will linger to see if you’re dead or just injured. If the bear is gone, back away slowly rather than running just in case they are watching from a distance. If the attack persists after you’ve played dead, fight back only as a last resort, and aim for the bear’s eyes and snout.


WOLVERINE-

Wolverines have a reputation for being scary, but they are more likely to just throw a tantrum in order to scare you since bluffing is their forte. They are also not large- similar to a medium sized dog.

You will rarely encounter these in the wild since they are shy and solitary creatures. As far as I know, there are no cases of wolverines attacking humans. Just go back the way you came, or if you continue, give them space and keep an eye out. It’s unlikely that they’ll hurt you.


PORCUPINE-

Porcupines are not often seen in the daytime as they are nocturnal and timid. They are short sighted and easily startled, so if you encounter a porcupine, walk a large distance around it if possible. They may swish their tail around which makes a strange noise, but unless you scare or threaten them, they are unlikely to quill you.

If quilled- remove them as quickly as possible so that the swelling doesn’t make it harder. Cut off the long end so that you can get a good grip on it and tug on it. If you can, do not twist or break it off. Do not use bare hands because this can injure your hand as well. If possible, wash the wounds well with soap and water and then apply antibiotic cream. Watch the wounds for redness, swelling, or itching. If you are quilled in the face or if the quills will not come out, see a doctor.

Encounter with a Mama (Black) Bear,157,itdxzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/itdxzx/encounter_with_a_mama_black_bear/,59,1600221465.0,"Hello I was recently hiking on the Coast in the Pacific Northwest and had a close encounter with a Mama black bear and two cubs.


I was hiking and saw a few fellow hikers yelling and whistling at something in the distance. A moment later I saw the outline of a bear on the beach zig zagging back and forth from the water to the forest line. The hikers said the Mama bear and cubs came out behind them from the woods. We watched for a second before realizing the bears were still coming towards us. 


We began yelling, using the emergency whistles we had on us, banging our hiking poles loudly over head, and saying ""hey bear!"" in a loud voice. Nothing seemed to stop her.


Figuring if we gave her ample space she would pass, or retreat into the woods. Unfortunately we backed (slowly) towards the water to let her pass (she had about 75 yards of beach to safely pass) instead she stopped, and made a 90 degree turn straight at us.


Once we realized she was walking right at us and wasn't stopping, and the only way out was to go swimming or try to climb a sea stack and having forgotten my bear spray in the car, I pulled out my pistol and fired once into the air (towards the ocean) . To our surprise the cubs ran but mama just stopped and stared.  We then fired twice more and she ran. Once she took off I decided wading through the water would be the safest and fastest way out. 


Less than five minutes later she was back on the beach in the same spot where we had fired the shots.


I know bears like to bluff to get you to back down, however since we were stuck with our backs toward the ocean with nowhere to retreat, would she have attacked had she gotten closer? 


Also lesson learned I won't be forgetting my bearspray again. All my life I've heard, ""bears are more scared of you then you are of them"", that really diddnt seem to be the case, she brazenly walked towards 5 of us being big, and loud which diddnt have any effect on her whatsoever.

2) The best thing to suck when you have no water is a salty lemon.  

3) You shouldn't eat when you are really thirsty, drinking water is more important.  

4) Apples help prevent you from getting thirsty.  

5) If you get really lost, follow the stars at night to the North Star. This will lead you home.  

6) Don't try to walk in a straight line. There are better ways to do this.  

7) Find a river. These are easier to find your way back from.  

8) Try to pollinate flowers when you are lost, as this will help you find your way back home.

9) If you have no water and are finding your way home, look for railroad tracks to the East. This is the quickest way home.  

10) If you are lost for more than 2 days, look for a light spot on the horizon. This could be a town and if you reach it, you will find your way from there.",Survival

And other hikers told me I am an idiot. It's pounds of additional weight for nothing. And I did not give a shit. Better be prepared, just in case.

Last week my gf slipped on a tricky descent in the mountains. She broke her leg in 2 places and tore a ligament (she is actually in surgery right now and will get some screws into her leg to fix the bones). I set her down, put the warm clothes on her when she started shivering and went into shock. I gave her pain killers and the go-pills to get her up again. I cut down a small tree to make a walking aid and put a stick on her leg with the bandages to immobilize it. Then we spend an hour moving down the mountain, little by little, until we got to a clearing with cell phone reception and could call for help. She was evacuated by chopper.

A little help with snowy survival...,5,ilkih8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ilkih8/a_little_help_with_snowy_survival/,15,1599127008.0,"I'll preface this by saying that none of the information I'm looking for is for practical / real life use. I'm working on a writing project and I'm finding that I wish I knew more about certain wilderness survival skills. With that being said...

&#x200B;

I'm working on a piece of writing that takes place in a very cold and snowy environment. My main character has been living in isolation, off the land for some amount of time. The climate isn't arctic but there are several feet of snow (at least) year round. There are plenty of trees (coniferous stuff) and lots of animals (both dangerous and not). In my head I'm picturing a colder version of the old growth forests of the pacific northwest in America. 

My main character survives by foraging and trapping I think, but I'm not fully sure how reasonable this is. I suppose my first question is: can a person survive, on their own, in conditions like I've described? 

What I'm trying to figure out specifically is what my main character's day-to-day looks like. What is the best method for building a semi-permanent shelter? What are some of the biggest dangerous to look out for that aren't immediately intuitive? Obviously I know that she is going to need to keep warm and fed, but are there other implications of the setting and environment that I'm not thinking of?

I like the idea of her getting a decent chunk of her daily food from traps she set, but I have absolutely no experience with designing, building, or setting traps. Any guidance at all on this topic would be super appreciated. 

My setting is post-apocalyptic sci-fi so I've got some wiggle room when it comes to what technology is available but obviously providing power to any kind of tech will be a hurdle, especially without a whole lot of sun. I already have a few fun ideas like a hovering pod to store food in so that bears can't get to it, but most of those details are being ironed out after I figure out the limits of snowy survival. 

My experience in this stuff begins and ends with digging out and sleeping in a snow cave when I was in boy scouts. I've been backpacking in warmer climates and my family growing up was pretty outdoorsy, but I'm just feeling a little lost on the living-off-the-land-in-a-never-ending-winter thing.

"Secrets to finding flint in areas where experts say there is no flint. It's a good survival skill to have- The ability to pick up a rock and make a tool, or use it to make fire. Flint and chert are highly prized for this. But what if you live in an area where “everyone says” there is none?",355,ihm6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ihm6yj/secrets_to_finding_flint_in_areas_where_experts/,31,1598567955.0,"One example is where I live-  New Hampshire, US.  Most of the sources say that there is no flint or chert to be found here.  The reason for that statement is that the sedimentary rock was scoured away by glaciers, and is now out in the ocean somewhere.  Almost all flint and chert is biological in origin, so it's found in sedimentary rock such as limestone.  There is no sedimentary bedrock here, so therefore no flint (or so they claim).  That statement is true, but only in a general sense.  You will not find it in the bedrock or exposed ledge.  You won't find large deposits of it.  But you can find it in the woods, and here are a few secrets -

Those same glaciers that scoured away our sedimentary bedrock also brought in rocks from far away.  Because of this one geologist wrote that you might find just about any kind of rock in New Hampshire.  The context was he was writing to the general public.  It wasn't a formal paper to fellow academics.  Still, his general observation was an amazing variety of rocks, so he wrote that you might find almost any kind of rock here.  And I would say this applies to a very large area, not only the small state of New Hampshire.  I believe that most of the North American continent was covered by glaciers at one time.  That means that flint or chert may have been brought there by glaciers from far away.

Where should you look for chert?  Look in stream and creek beds.  Ones with a fast current are better because it tends to keep the rocks clean from algae, moss, and other vegetation.  Also look alongside the trail and along the road.  Let's face it-  It's much easier to find rocks on the surface of the ground than dig for them.  Mining is a lot of work, obviously.  When you find a rock that you suspect to be chert, you may have to break it open in order to identify it.

Another place to look for chert is along old Indian trails and areas settled by them.  One way that rocks move is by being carried by humans.  The American Indians had an extensive trade network, and one commodity was chert.  Many roads and trails in the US were originally Indian trails.  Some of these can be found in old records.  But most (I believe) you would have to find by talking to people or knowing how to recognize them.  You can also learn to identify likely settlements.  This topic I plan to address later.

The last secret I want to go over today is finding lost or discarded gun flints.  Poor people used flintlocks in rural areas long after the invention of percussion firearms and even cartridge ammunition.  So you might find flint in and around old cellar holes, and also in hunting areas.  Certain vantage points have always been good for hunting with a firearm.  If you see a tree stand, spent casings, etc on a ridge if you look carefully you might find flint as well.

Before I sign off, I would like to thank Jay of Vision Quest Outdoors for his help.  I also thank him for challenging me to go out and find chert in the woods.  Check out his Youtube channel if you get a chance.

I hope this helps you.  I also want to give you a challenge.  I'm calling it Chert Quest 2020.  Go out and try to find chert in your area, especially if it is an area where people say it doesn't exist.

God bless!

“Survival” story,28,ifrozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/ifrozt/survival_story/,7,1598313460.0,"
So here’s a little survival story from last year. It is a story of failure and success. Like with everything in the woods there were many teaching moments but I do believe that the most important thing for me that I learned is that in the end the most important tool you posses is your mind.

In May last year I took off in my kayak alone for about 5 days on Delaware River. I was planning to do about 80 miles and camp along the way. Mind you I do 30-40 mile trips on that river every month from April till November so I’m fairly familiar with the waters as well as with my boat. I had about 5 days worth of food and most of my equipment is fairly new as my wife does good deal of backpacking so whenever something better and lighter comes out she passes her old gear to me. Everything is in watertight bags and stored either inside of the kayak or strapped to the top. I have multiple means of making fire, tools, etc etc...

From the begging it’s a rough start. It rained non stop for 2 weeks and waters are little elevated. Again nothing new there so I hop in with my life jacket on and start cruising. Thing is I’m going way to fast, dogging dead trees that current picked up from the shores because of elevated waters. I knock almost twenty five  miles of my trip in 4 hours and I’m not even tired. I keep on taking water but not much and I write it off as on and off showers and waves. Out of the sudden water keeps rising and I feel a surge of current so I decide to stop for a quick meal but every suitable site I know is either under water or banks are so steep I can’t climb them. On top of that it started pouring again and now I’m just looking to get out and set up camp. Finally I find a place. It’s little steep but it can be done. I see bottom about one foot down. I nose my kayak in and wedge it into a strainer that is on the side of the river and jump out. I realize I misjudged the depth and with one leg out and another one still inside I fall over tilting my kayak. Within seconds my boat is full of water and I’m pinned at my chest against the strainer. Cords on top of the boat get wet and loose and gear shifts and starts floating way. Food that was packed in the front of the boat also shifts and falls out and after few seconds of floating sinks. This is part of the adventure right? I try pushing the kayak off my chest and dive underneath to finally get free. My first priority is to secure the boat but now filled with water and sideways it is almost impossible. I manage to flip it outright and it still floats due to some gear being in the waterproof bags. I grab my tow rope and climb ashore and secure the boat to the tree. I look down river and see my waterproof pack caught on another strainer so I run quickly to get it. I run thru the bushes on the bank of the river, jump in but misjudge the strength of the current so I miss the pack. I climb to the shore and try again. This time I’m lucky. At this point I’m cold as temps are in the low 50s and water is pretty freezing. As I’m walking back to the camp I hear a tearing sound and see my kayak floating away. I jump in to intercept it and steer it onto the bank of the river. Tilt it over and pour the water out than remove the dry bags. Hauling to boat up to the high ground in the mud I realized that handles I used to secure the rope to my boat got torn away. Finally I’m done. I’m cold, wet and need to change into something dry, get the inventory going and evaluate the situation. I pile up all the gear I have left and stretch up a tarp over me to work away from the rain. All I’m dreaming about is some dry clothes and fire. Here’s another snafu: all my nice gear inside the waterproof bags is wet and so are all my belongings in the waterproof pack. How is this possible? Well I’ve been using them bags and pack for the last ten years. They’ve seen their fair share of abuse and between that, wear and tear and degradation they were maybe sprinkle proof but not submersion proof. Everything I have is soaking wet except for my boots which I managed to put in the garbage bag. Most of my food is gone but I have enough, plus there is enough water to boil and I have my stove except that there is something wrong with the stove because I soon as I screw it onto the gas canister it starts leaking. Trying to change the oring with cold shaky hands is nearly impossible but I manage but the stove still leaks. Ok it’s a problem but I got 3 different ways to start the fire so I’m not worried. I go to collect wood and I realized that I must be in a pretty popular place to camp as within 200 yards I’m not finding much of the dead fall wood and besides that everything is wet. I keep trying for an hour trying to get the fire going but I can’t. I have a Randal survival knife with back up fire starter and kindling in the handle except water got in there and them little kindlings are wet as well. Anytime fire catches a bit it dies out quickly. Now I’m really cold, it’s getting dark, I’m still wet and hungry. I look at the river, now at the highest point I saw in 10 years and where the strainer was that I originally pulled in I see a floating porta-potty and next to it there is a plastic bag with some of my food (ramen noodles and some buns). I tie of the rope to myself and swim up grab the bag and as I’m ready to pull myself back the ports potty shifts door open and I get covered in feces. Thank god for strong current because most of it floats away quickly. As I’m ready to leave I see a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall of the ports potty and pull it off. I half swim half drag myself back to the camp. I strip naked and set off to again collect the fire wood (which later on led to poison ivy in bad places) and haul as much as I can. Again I try my hand at the fire but this time twigs are coated with hand sanitizer from the porta-john. Fire catches and I start feeding it and before I know it I have this huge roaring fire. It also stoped raining so I set up the cloth and gear drying lines all around. I get a pot of water from the river and start boiling it throwing ramen in there with whatever other stuff I could find. It’s dark now but some of my clothes are dry enough to wear. I continue rotating gear on the lines so it dries evenly and before midnight my tent and pad are dry enough. Sleeping bag not so much. I take the tarp and angle it down by the fire and create an improvised lean to shelter and spread my pad. My fleece and jacket are also dry so that will do for a night. I fall asleep waking up every few hours to add more wood to the fire. Miserable night but I’m dry and sort of warm. In the morning sun comes out but it’s still cold. Fire is still going strong, things that were wet are still wet but I’m in good spirits. I know where I am and after going over my food I know I have enough.. It’s not going to be gourmet meals I was planning but it’s all good. I plan to spend the day at that site, getting things dry. While inspecting the boat I find a hole by the rear that was created by years of dragging the kayak on pavement ramps. I find a pine tree and collect some sap and force it into the crack and cover it with duct tape. Day went uneventful consisting of collecting fire wood, turning gear over and by the end of it my sleeping bag was dry and I got some decent sleep. Day 3 in the morning water started to recede a bit but it was still fast. I pack the kayak not realizing that I made it little bit too top heavy and when hopping in again I slip and flip it over again. Thank god I packed everything I couldn’t afford to get wet like my sleeping bag, pad, boots and spare clothing into the garbage bag and than slid it into the worthless waterproof sack to prevent the garbage bag from tearing. I’m laughing because I haven’t flipped in many years and now it’s twice in 3 days. I drain the boat, redistribute the weight and hop in. Water is still fast so I knock first ten miles in an hour and a half when it starts raining and that changes into the downpour. At this point I’m like screw this and made the decision to go all way to the end and get in my car. Between current and paddling I got there within 6 or 7 hours. Hauled my kayak to the back of my car, called a local camping place about 30 miles away and rented a cabin for two nights. On the way there I swung by Wally World and got some dry clothes and food. That was the end. The reason I’m sharing this story now is because on my recent trip as I stepped on the bank of the river I realized I was wearing the same clothes as during that faithful trip last year. 

Now it was a learning and humbling experience. Mistakes such as gear negligence, overconfidence in equipment and skills that were rusty were corrected later that summer. I realized that even thou I’m in my kayak all the time I rarely practiced any emergency procedures so I got to work on that. My broken down defective gear was replaced with newer one that is inspected regularly. I looked for solutions on how to better pack my kayak and found a lot of helpful suggestions which I implemented and as for fire well that’s a work in progress but that’s something I practice a lot and I’m getting better. Still I pack redundant ways of making fire and every chance I get I start it with a method that I don’t yet feel comfortable. Holes in my kayak were repaired with fiberglass.

Now as far as how really of the survival situation that was. Well not gonna lie I could have called for help as the river has rangers patrolling it and even thou I don’t know if they would come out in that weather that was a lifeline. I had no cell signal at the place I was in but pretty sure a short hike would have changed that. I knew exactly where I was and which way the local road was so I could have hiked out if needed abandoning most of my gear. I wasn’t hurt except for my pride. I considered hiking to the road but after starting the fire and getting some food everything seemed ok and the situation was just a case of bad luck. Now as far as the water surges and levels are concerned it happened due to rains which caused multiple damm releases. When I pulled into the place I was met with the ranger who told me I shouldn’t been on the river and company that transported my kayak should have told me that as warnings were sent out. Due to my bath with feces I called my doc but since I have hep a/b shots due to my work that Is checked yearly he told me I will be ok. In the end thank you for reading this enjoy and have good laugh at my expense.",Survival

Knife is for sure required, but I have my folding knife. Is the belt knife necessary if I have a hatchet (for splitting wood)?

Can't get a decent machete here, but I have a banana knife that does the same job (thin curved blade on a 2 ft handle). Only job it does that the others don't do well is cutting brush or use as a weapon. It's beveled on only one side so it sucks for splitting

Saw for cutting trees and bamboo and crafting. Actually wouldn't consider NOT bringing both a fine toothed and coarse toothed blade.

Hatchet? Can baton with the belt knife (belt knife would work better for bamboo in fact), can cut trees with the saw. Only thing I can think of is splitting solid wood, and I don't imagine myself doing that much. 

Had a really thick local-style machete, but it sucks at everything. The point is curved like you'd use it to stab which makes it terrible for chopping, it's too thick so it won't cut brush, the balance sucks so it's not great for fighting either (I imagine). Only thing it does better than anything else is batoning (the balance sucks so bad that I wouldn't even want to try chopping by swinging the damn thing). The steel is so hard I can't even sharpen it with a file, but it throws sparks pretty easily I guess.",Survival

The transition boundary from suburban to rural of the “greater metro area” is easily an hour away if the freeways are totally empty.  Similarly, on totally clear 65mph (90mph actual) freeways, we’d have to drive 4 hours to get to any public land.  

Obviously, in a the event of riots, tornadoes, emp, or any other event, the freeways would not be clear.

\- My characters are walking in dry open bushland, surrounded by shrubs maybe up to two metres tall

\- Ahead of them is a valley, perhaps 30m deep

\- Within the valley are trees, and under the trees are hollow dens large enough to crawl inside

A storm is approaching and I'm trying to justify my character's decision to shelter from the storm within a tree hollow, for plot reasons.

I think it's best to search for low-lying ground during a thunder storm, but hiding in the hollow of a tree sounds a bit suspect.

Can it be justified? What would you do in this scenario?",Survival

At least it helps me practice floating my hands but it is still very frustrating to put up so much work without any results.

I should add that all the wood I use is dry, some of the branches I was using were making contact with the floor but I only took the parts that were in the air.

So with the little knowledge I have I ask:

1. What am I most likely doing wrong?
2. What trees/bushes should I keep an eye out for?
3. Is it a matter of powering through it?
4. Is there a more efficient Technic that is used in deserts rather than the bow and drill?

I hope you can all help me out on this quest.

- I am NOT looking for a very lightweight mylar/space blanket
- Sleeping bag suggestions are welcome. I just feel all sleeping 
  bags, even expensive ones, will be bulkier and heavier than a more

As one of the adults I suggested tarps and hammocks.  I covered a mock setup at one of our last meetings in my back yard and since setting that tarp up, I've done a bit of work to make up a kit for the scouts to put together for their personal gear.

I've put together a fastrope system for the ridge line, making use of a bowline with a bite on the loop end, storing 2 shorter prusiks on the fastrope, which then gets rolled into the tarp, securing the package with 2 more semi-adjustable loops using fisherman's knots to form the loop and give these a little adjustability for roll size.  Not all the boys have the hand/arm strength to get these rolled super tight.  These two loops will be used for additional prusics, as needed.

Most of them don't have the cash to fork over for a ulta-lightweight fly, so most will be rolling with 9x9's or 9x11 foot harbor freight blue tarps.  Watching some videos yesterday, I saw someone suggested running the ridge line above the tarp.  I kinda like this idea and will use toggles and prusik knots and toggles to tension the tarp to the ridge  line.  This may change how we deploy lights inside the tarp though.  I'm also suggesting to the scouts to make use of a drip line and other water blocks on the hammock straps.

Looking for other suggestions to keeping the boys dry.  Saturday looks to be a complete washout :)  Can't wait.

Eldorado national forest trip report,6,hd2424,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hd2424/eldorado_national_forest_trip_report/,14,1592749765.0,"I took a trip with another friend of mine into eldorado national forest. We stayed from the 13th-20th of June. I brought in 15,100 calories of food in total. I brought a garmin inreach mini satellite messenger, bear bag, clothes, tarp, rain gear, sleep system, a knife, and a multitool and other miscellaneous items. I am a wilderness first and have been practicing survival skills for a long time. Here’s a breakdown of the trip by day.

Day 1: Dropped off. My own carelessness and not checking google maps which I had downloaded a map of the area on was a mistake. If I did we’d have realized that the directions we had found to get to this area were not good. We wasted 45 minutes of walking before I checked out of suspicion that we weren’t even near the trailhead. We were about ten miles or so of walking on highways away from it. So I drop some pins marking a path to walk to the trailhead but it’s still some distance to cover given it’s already about 2 pm, so we walked as far as we could to get there. We stopped walking at about 4 by a big creek and set up camp. We were still many miles off from our destination. 2 important details to mention are that I collected some mullein (non native to the area and grows a lot by roads) on the walk in and also that my left boot got wet crossing the river to hang up the bear bag. 

Day 2: We had planned to get up early so we can rush to our destination. My left boot was wet so I was unable to walk with it on, because even in the summer the morning air and the water of that boot were super cold for my left foot. I opted to walk in three layers of socks until it warmed up and could put on the shoes bearably. Don’t let your shoes get wet, people. We eventually arrive and go to set up cam, trying several different locations trying to find a good spot. Eventually we find one that is somewhat close to the lake but is maybe 40 feet  above it with an easy route down. I assumed that the increase in elevation and relative dryness of that spot would mean few mosquitos and boy was I wrong. The mosquitos were very annoying and made me regret not bringing a mosquito net which would have weighed nothing. Also, when I went to fill my water bladder, I heard a rattling noise and after a second I realize that’s a rattler and back away from the noise. I saw him going under a log about 15 feet away from me after I had vigorously backed away. This was a mildly terrifying experience but it was reassuring he seemed to be on the defensive and that he didn’t want anything to do with me. I ended up seeing a number of other snakes during this trip including a California striped racer, 2 sierra gartners and another snake I can’t remember the name of.

Days 3 and 4: Here’s where Id have to start looking into my notebook because around here the days start blurring together. I remember being very low on energy, until I had taken my first dump of the trip. i don’t know if it’s because of that or because I wasn’t eating enough but I digress. I taught my friend several different deadfall trap variations, including the paiute (really good with how high friction the granite there is), the figure 4, and the sam sea. We did not set any unattended or bait any and were just fucking with them for fun. Doing this and attempting to drop a coal on the bow drill (once again for fun because fires were not permitted) made me realize how bad the materials you have to work with can be. Nothing I tried would work for bow drill, aspen, sierra juniper, doug fir, I even tried pine because I wanted the coal so badly, and none of it worked. All of the wood would gloss up super quickly even if I knew it to be a good wood for friction fire. or it would pass the thumbnail test. Also at this point I realized I had fucked up in leaving my chapstick at home because my lips were giant black scabs at this point.

Day 5: Remeber that mullein I mentioned earlier? Well I did a hand drill on an incense cedar hearth board with it and it was amazing. Dropped 2 coals with this combo where bow drill had completely failed me. On the drive out I stopped the car to take home some more mullein (once again not a native plant) for practice at home. 

Day 6: On this day my friend and I use his John Muir Law’s guide to sierra nevada to identify all different kinds of organisms to make a species list. That was pretty fun and a good way to kill time because time at this point had started to drag a bit. I took a swim in the lake. My friend and I made a giant ass paiute deadfall for fun. That was pretty much it.

Day 7: at this point Im just really bored of messing with paiutes and my hands are fucked up from paiute deadfalls/granite/handdrill so there wasn’t a ton to do outside of just relax and try to observe nature and take it in. A technique I like to use called a silent sit or a sit spot which is essentially just sitting in a spot and trying to observe nature and eventually animals will come close to you and start coming out of hiding. I spent roughly 2 hours in one spot just admiring my last full day there. This was the worst night in terms of mosquitos. 

Day 8. Hiked out to our pick up spot. I packed up a few primitive skills materials, my favorite paiute, and some hearthboards I had made from incense cedar sticks from the ground. Our ride was a bit late so we hiked down the road towards it to get to a main road in hopes of getting service because the garmin inreach was all but dead. Luckily our ride appeared while we were hiking back. 

**TL;DR/takeaways**
Use your modern technology to your advantage. Vague instructions from the forest service and other parties can fuck you over. 

Bring chapstick. 

Bring some kind of way of dealing with bugs. 

Don’t let your boots get wet, or any piece of clothing for that matter. 

You will have a lot of down time and I’d imagine in a survival situation you’d be trying to save energy or make things that are  useful while hiding from the elements. 

I probably should have brought sunscreen.

Take advantage of resources as you pass them when it is ethical to do so. 

You won’t always have good materials so traps like the figure 4 which seem pretty dependent on good materials have a severe disadvantage to something you can make which mediocre materials like the paiute. 

Make sure you know what to do with venomous snakes.

Bears!,247,hcycbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/hcycbt/bears/,70,1592732645.0,"I originally wrote this as a comment to another post. There are so many posts on here about ""I'm new to the wilderness what's up with bears?"" I figured I'd post this as it's own sticky post. This is geared towards new people and there are exceptions to most of what I say. Nothing is gospel in survival. Even the best trained and most experienced outdoorsmen sometimes come home in body bags. I would love to hear from anyone about mistakes I made or things I left out, although remember this is a post targeted at beginners so it's main aim is to give people a set of basic, easy to follow guidelines to minimize the chance of being injured or killed by a bear.

Now, here is my comment, repurposed as this post:

When you see a bear give them a big hug, they are famous for hugging!

Seriously though, wild camping is actually a very very safe hobby. Considering the amount of people that take to the wild every year it's not actually that big of a deal to camp in bear country. Black bears are by far the most common bears to encounter. Between 1997 and 2017 there were 25 fatal black bear attacks in North America https://www.wideopenspaces.com/list-fatal-black-bear-attacks-north-america-last-20-years/ and also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America To put that in context, in just Yellowstone National Park in only the year 2018 there were 4.1 million visitors. The best place to start for safety in bear country in the US is here: https://www.nps.gov/articles/bearattacks.htm The most comprehensive book is still *Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance* by Herrero https://www.amazon.com/Bear-Attacks-Their-Causes-Avoidance/dp/149302941X

Basically there are 3 rules.

1st give them their space.

2nd don't mess with their cubs.

Those are obvious.

The 3rd and most important one is food. The vast majority of adults who get hurt by black bears do so because the bear was seeking the person's food and the person got hurt in the process. Make 3 separate spots: one for camping/sleeping one for cooking one for food storage. Don't bring food into your campsite or cook in your campsite. If possible the cooking and food storage sites should be downwind of the campsite so that the bear doesn't wander through your camp seeking your food. This may not be possible in areas with variable winds. Hang up your food or use a bear canister. If you hang your food don't just lazily hang it over a tree branch. Use two pieces of cordage tied to the food bag and suspend the bag at least 15' above the ground and 10' from either tree, by tying a rock to each piece of cordage and tossing it over a branch and then hoisting the bag up. Hang all smelly stuff, not just food: toothpaste sunscreen etc.

Here's a pic of what I mean from a duckduckgo search https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hang+bear+bag&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outsidebozeman.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Flarge%2Fpublic%2FBearBag.jpg%3Fitok%3D_xfgGO_O

There's other ways of doing it but that's the best one. The PCT method is 2nd best. Hang your bear bag in an area that is surrounded by open spaces so you can see whether or not the food is still hanging that way you don't walk up on them while they are munching on your GORP. Even with all the tricks I gave bears still mights get your food because they are real smart. Bear canisters or certain models of UrSak are probably the best overall but are expensive and bulky and don't hold much. You could always just store your food in your car.

If you encounter a black bear on the trail and it doesn't run away (or more likely meander away grumbling to itself) first option is to make yourself big and obvious, wave your arms, yell, etc. ***DO NOT RUN AWAY OR TURN YOUR BACK***. If you encounter a grizzly bear yelling and waving may provoke a defensive attack; look around to try to spot any cubs (you want to move away from the cubs not towards them and when startled the cubs may freeze, being furry and brown they are not that obvious) then back away slowly while keeping the bear in sight. Do not look the bear in the eyes. If the bear charges just throw it your backpack so it can have your food. Seriously. You can buy more Clif Bars. It's not worth getting injured or killed. If the bear is charging and throwing your backpack doesn't work then stand your ground. Use your bear spray or firearm if you have it ready. ***DO NOT RUN FROM A CHARGING BEAR***. Most charges are bluffs, running from a bluff may change the bluff attack into a real one. After the bear bluff charges return to backing away while keeping the hear in sight. Refer to my later section for differences between blacks and grizzlies regarding actual attacks.

Guns and bear spray are good options for defense if you are attacked. Of the two bear spray is objectively superior even among seasoned firearms users. For most people carrying a gun in the woods is more dangerous than any bear. However if you are experienced in handling and utilizing firearms they can be good options. If you aren't I would recommend against it. Neither are necessary if all you've got is black bears but they still might be wise depending on the bear activity in your particular area. In grizzly country you should carry bear spray even if you carry a firearm: either bear spray alone or bear spray + gun. When carrying bear spray do not carry it in your backpack. Carry it in a holster that you can access with one hand without looking at it. Practice drawing the bear spray from it's holster and presenting it several times before each trip so you can discover any problems, for example if it gets caught in your shirt or if it gets covered by your backpack's waist belt you need to address that. Practice while wearing your full kit and the clothes you hike in.

In black bear country .357 mag is the preferred choice among most. In grizzly country  it's classically been .44 mag but the current trend is toward 10mm. Most bear attacks that have been stopped by firearms have been stopped by 9mm using self defense rounds, simply because 9mm is the most common pistol caliber people carry for self defense. There are several recorded instances of grizzly bears being killed with .22lr.

If you are attacked by a black bear it's likely predatory so fight back with everything you have. Even if it's only your fists. If you are attacked by grizzly bears it's likely defensive so play dead by assuming the fetal position and covering your neck and head with your arms and hands as best you can.

I really don't like bear bells. There is no evidence they work and they scare off all the other wildlife and ruin it for other hikers. Major outdoor educators such as NOLS and Outward Bound have done away with bear bells in their classes even in grizzly country. The better option is to educate yourself about bears, and move deliberately and be observant. Don't let yourself get lulled into just mindlessly plodding down the trail. Every once and awhile stop and observe your surroundings. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Remember, it's better to heed that ""not right"" feeling and find out the feeling was wrong than to ignore that ""not right"" feeling and find out it was right.

As for snooping around your campsite? Yeah they're gonna do that regardless they are real curious. If you are out long enough a bear WILL come into your camp probably at night and you won't know it. If you don't have anything that interests them they'll nose around a bit then leave. A fun exercise is to clear all the debris from around your shelter, dig up the dirt a bit so it's nice and fluffy, then smooth it out so the dirt is still soft but very even. Then when you wake up you can see the tracks of all the critters that came to say hi. There will be many tracks, mostly rodents, and eventually, yes, bears.

And please remember that in wild nature, energy is precious so by and large the animals are not out to get you because in most places hunting humans is more trouble than it's worth so animals don't do it. Of course you should take precautions -that's why I'm writing this- but don't let caution become paranoia because that can ruin your experience.

Finally, the best piece of advice is that if you see a bear in the wild (and are not attacked) consider yourself lucky. Bears are really really cool animals and vital parts of the ecosystem.",Survival

He is wearing hiking clothing and waterproof jacket, helmet, gloves but the pants are just regular jeans. He only planned to be in and out within maximum two hours. (you could say he is ill prepared and relying on two guides that came with him)

He stumbles and falls - gets separated from the guides - into one of the rainwater deposits, but can climb out without much problem, but he'll need to spend the night before he could get out.

**The question is: in the situation described above which is more viable to avoid hypothermia?**

**A:** get out of his drenched clothing, wring it out then put back on and rely on his body heat to be trapped by the waterproof jacket or

**B:** get out of his drenched clothing and don't get them back on for the night?

I'm kind of split between the options because I've been in situations where I had to spend a full day in drenched clothing somewhere around 15°C (69°F) in constant rain, but either I had shelter that was dry or had fire, but this scenario is underground, in a constantly wet/damp/humid environment without the possibility of lighting fire.

Trip Report -- Backpacking in Arizona's Rim Country,7,h02sn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/h02sn4/trip_report_backpacking_in_arizonas_rim_country/,8,1591788190.0,"https://reddit.com/link/h02sn4/video/pewmd96l40451/player

I backpacked into a remote area of Arizona, planning ""about"" seven to nine days, starting the Memorial Day Weekend. As it turned out, the trip was six days, and it was an example of knowing when to nope out that I'll get into in a bit.

I'm being deliberately vague about the location of this canyon. It's remote enough, and challenging enough, that I almost never see people. I'd like to keep it that way. For remote places like this I figure the price of admission is finding it yourself.

It's north of Arizona's Mogollon Rim, at an elevation of about 6500 feet. There is perennial water (and lots of it), and an impressive amount of wildlife.

Note that I was purposely taking it very easy on this trip. I'd done something unpleasant to my back about three weeks before, and didn't want to aggravate the injury. Also, I was more interested in exploring the area than I was in putting in lots of miles. This region has a rich history dating back 5000 years (prehistoric Native Americans) and all the way to the modern day, with ranching starting in the 1800s and CCC work in the 1930s, so there's lots of stuff to find.

The first day, I hiked in about a mile and set up camp at an old campground. The campground is long abandoned -- it was built by the CCC and was gone to ruins in the 80s when I first saw it. It still has a picnic table, some foundations, and the remnants of road leading into it, but isn't on any maps and isn't used for camping except by the occasional backpacker.

However, it was a three day weekend, and right after I set up, a family with mom, dad, teenage daughter and daughter's boyfriend appeared -- first time in about five years (and about 20 trips, including other three day weekends) that I've run into anyone else in the area. They were fly fishing, catching crawdads for dinner, and having a good time while. However, I decided to move a bit farther up the canyon the next day. I wanted solitude and they said they were coming back daily to fish for a few more days.

The following morning, I hiked about another two miles up the canyon, and ran across my first rattlesnake in the middle of the trail, having a sunbath. I was alertly watching for snakes as the conditions were perfect, so I saw him first and shoo'd him off the trail with the end of a trekking pole.

I also saw the first of several small groups of turkeys. In the late morning I made camp on a sand bar (there was zero chance of flooding), and poked around a bit. The sandbar was not an ideal campsite, however, as the sand was fine silty crap that was getting in everything. Also, once the morning breezes died down there were black flies everywhere and -- when the wind shifted that evening -- there was a very strong scent of both skunk and carrion. It was too late in the day to move camp when things got stinky, so I sucked it up for the night.

As a side note, in most canyons you can plan on up-canyon winds during the day and down-canyon winds at night. The only time this isn't true is when a strong weather system is coming through.

The next day I found the source of the dead animal stink about a hundred yards up the canyon -- a large bull elk that had been reduced to bones, scraps, and a very bad lingering smell. I looked for the skull, but didn't find it.

I moved another mile and a half up the canyon that day. Saw another rattlesnake while hiking, plus several other non-poisonous snakes.

The third camp was on a bench overlooking a nice series of pools of water. It was high enough to catch a breeze (so fewer biting insects) and there was a nice carpet of pine needles under some of the biggest ponderosas I've ever seen. I made camp, washed my clothes, got cleaned up myself, and lazed about.

The fourth day I day-hiked up the canyon several miles and saw rattlesnake #3 on a sunny rock. He took off in a hurry and swam across the creek. I also saw more turkeys, and came across some sort of  foundation made with two six foot sections of heavy steel I-beams plus lots of rocks. There were a few sections of 4"" steel pipe headed off into the brush but I couldn't follow it very far. My guess is at some point there was a really big pump down there by the creek. It's all limestone in there, so it would not be related to gold mining. I don't know what they were pumping water for, unless it was going several miles to the CCC camp up on the plateau above the canyon.

I attempted to go for a swim as the daytime temps were in the 90s. Nope. Cold water was COLD. Got elbow deep, decided I didn't need to prove anything to anyone when I'm out by myself, and then departed the water in a hurry.

The fifth day I hiked up a side canyon and found a shallow cave under a ledge. It was maybe 6 feet tall at the entrance and pinched off about ten feet back. There was soot on the roof and charcoal mixed in the with the dirt on the ground, so I expect it was used as a shelter going back to prehistoric times. It as not really big enough for anyone to live in, though, and it was in a shady bend in the side canyon that would be icy cold in winter. However, for a summer hunting camp? I'm sure they took full advantage of it. I hung out there for half an hour eating a snack and enjoying the cool breeze coming from the cracks in the rocks.

The whole time I was hiking that day I was thinking, ""This is the perfect place to find a snake when it warms up."" And then it warmed up and I was like, ""Okay, now it's perfect conditions, perfect snake weather. BE CAREFUL."" And I was poking likely looking bushes with my hiking poles as I walked, and avoiding areas of tall lovegrass, and going around logs rather than stepping over them ...

... and I still damn near stepped on a very angry little rattlesnake, even though I was actively watching as I walked. He blended right in.

After detouring around the snake (poking him with my hiking stick failed to get him to move out of the way, he bit my stick) I headed back to camp on very high alert. That was snake #4.

I decided after seeing four rattlesnakes, and nearly stepping on one, it was time to bail on the trip. I was in no mood to keep exploring after the last close call. I've been going to this cabin since the 1980s and had seen zero rattlers up to this point.

The snakes will settle down after a week or two -- it was the first really warm weather of the year and they were coming out of hibernation and looking for a meal. In the meantime, however, it was just plain time to nope. I decided I'd leave the next morning.

The last afternoon I made crawdad tails in ramen -- I caught two dozen large crawdads with a piece of beef stick on a string, in under half an hour.

The last night, around 9 PM, I was awakened by the sound of an elk grunting and a bear bellowing, about a quarter mile away up the canyon. I have to say that I have never heard anything like that before, and I've backpacked and lived in remote areas for a few decades ... I've only ever heard elk grunt during the rut when they're fighting with each other. It was pretty alarming for awhile, but then all was silent.

In the predawn hours, the coyotes started up.

At dawn, the crows started cawing like they do when they've found carrion.

Hmm. I assume the bear got himself an elk.

I decided discretion was the better part of valor, and I cut a wide berth around the area by bushwhacking up the (fortunately not steep) hills. I gave it several hundred yards of room. I really didn't want to confront a bear on a yummy kill .. the local bears will usually run from people, but why take chances? I also made LOTS of noise as I traveled.

I hiked out without seeing any more snakes, and made an uneventful exit to my car.

Various observations and things I learned:

\-- I had a down sleeping bag with me, one of the ones with no down on the underside. In theory this saves weight, but I've decided I dislike this concept. The first two nights were cold (30s) and every time I moved I had to readjust the sleeping bag to cover me, because the lack of insulation on the bottom let in the cold. Lots of cold air leaks and it kept waking me up. The last three nights were in the 50s and 60s and the bag was too warm, but better a bag that's too warm than not warm enough.

\-- The plastic piezo button on my stove caught fire when I was boiling up the crawdads. I had an extra large pot, had piled rocks around it on three sides to protect it from the wind, and apparently there was too much heat for the plastic. It was a cheap stove and not a huge deal from a ""can I still use this"" standpoint. I just needed to light it with a match after that. However, I was glad I'd cleared a several foot area clean of pine needles, with the stove in the middle, because the spring inside the piezo launched the burning plastic a couple of feet from the stove. (Sproing!) It easily could have started a fire if I wasn't paying attention and/or hadn't cleared the area.

\-- Meat bees (yellow jackets) like crawdad tails more than anything else in the world. I knew this. I've known this a long time. Each time I cook crawdads I tell myself not to cook the crawdads in camp. It would be smarter to do it down by the creek. Each time, I go, ""How bad can it be?"" And then I cook crawdads in camp and I vow never to do that again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

\-- I had skipped taking a footprint for my tent, and used my poncho for a footprint, since it wasn't likely to rain. This meant I had nothing to sit on in camp other than rocks or the ground -- usually I unroll the poncho and use it as a picnic blanket. I have a habit of laying on my back and reading books in the shade in the heat of the afternoon. I got a lot dirtier without the poncho to lay on, and was generally unhappy sitting in the dirt. (I expect to get dirty when backpacking, but this was a bit excessive.) Next time I am taking the footprint and/or an extra poncho, it's worth the extra weight.

I'm going out this weekend to the same area for a quick overnight -- hopefully the snakes have found themselves meals and have quit wandering around where I might step on them.

I am experimenting on this next trip with just taking some Old Trapper beef sticks, dried fruit, granola bars, and candy rather than full meals. I find making a meal a nuisance. It also saves a lot of weight if I don't have to haul along a stove, fuel, and a mess kit.",Survival

Clothing Cold/Warm Discussion,3,gzbos0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gzbos0/clothing_coldwarm_discussion/,12,1591690136.0,"So, the old problem: clothing. What do you pack in your bag and what do you wear, specifically how do you manage large temperature differences? For example, if you are in the desert and being nude is still too hot, but at night you freeze your ass off, how do you manage this difference? And also How do you keep cool?

My ideas for packing warming clothes in a very small space (which is  always important) are space blankets, or wool clothes. of course there are problems with that, concerning durability or rain/water. You can of course add rain cover or durable special fabrics, but there may not be any room.

But the bigger problem, which i do not have ANY ideas to solve (in a survival scenario where recources are valuable as hell) is how to keep relatively cool, while carrying all you gear, your clothes for the cold and also while protecting yourself from the sun. Of course, sunscreen may be an option, but not always due to an allergy, suplly chain failure etc. or you might not have it with you in that particular scenario, so I will just assume that one uses long cloths to keep the sun away from the skin.

Almost Died On Sunday...,1073,gvn0b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gvn0b3/almost_died_on_sunday/,117,1591187360.0,"I have this high quality, 12 foot inflatable fishing boat. After investing in a medium sized motor, the stars aligned right, and I was able to go fishing on Sunday.

I decided to troll (drag a lure behind the boat) about 1-1.5 miles out, and then switch to bait fishing. I trolled about a mile offshore, got one of my poles set up and in the water, but on the calmest of days and in the actual middle of the ocean, I drifted into a reef. 

I turned my throttle to the fastest reverse setting, and in doing so, the current shifted me parallel just in time for a GOD DAMN rogue wave to hit me from the side, and flip my boat. Im fairly certain either the plywood flooring or the hinged top to my plywood storage box, hit me on the head and discombobulated me for like 10-15 second as I watched literally everything sink to the ocean floor.

I finally came to, and the first thing I decided was I needed to get my ""Oh Shit"" bag, I packed just in case something happened. So I swam to my storage box that was like 5 feet away from me, and grabbed my bag. I resurfaced, opened my bag, and pulled out my goggles and swim fins. I was underwater trying to get my fins on, but at the same time I was trying to keep the contents of my bag inside while I was getting smashed on on this reef.

I finally got everything on and figured that swimming to my boat, that was about 20 feet from me, was my best strategy to regain my bearing. When I was around 5-10 feet from the boat, I saw my storage box got tangled in my docking rope and was dragging behind the boat. I opened the lid to the box to see if anything was still inside, and the first thing I grabbed was the knife. Then I decided to grab my tackle box and some rope just in case. I swam to the boat with all that stuff just to realize that the 80 lb boat, was flipped upside down. Im not sure how, but on the first try I flipped the boat over, with ONE HAND!

I threw everything in the boat, and launched myself inside. After I laid there for a second to catch my breath, I sat up and didn't see any deep cuts or bleeds. I looked around to see how far I was from shore and to see if I could see any of my stuff. I saw my cooler, my life jacket, and a small red container, all spread out in different directions around 10ft feet from the boat. My paddles and motor were gone, and I knew I needed my life jacket and the water / food from the cooler. Unfortunately, the current was taking the life jacket in a different direction than me, but luckily, the cooler was about to float by me. As if nothing else could go wrong, the cooler was about 6 inches out of my reach.

I thought about what to do next and what my best chance of survival was. It was a toss up between packing what I could in my dry bag and swimming to the closest shore that was at least a mile away, or stay in the boat and either hope someone passes by me or hope the current took me towards land instead of out to sea. I decided that I had my fins and goggles, but also had confidence in my swimming ability (since I used to be a swimmer and remember the form for sidestroke, freestyle, backstroke, and breast stroke), so I thought it the best option would be to swim back. 

The physical part of swimming in the ocean wasn't as bad as the mental aspect. Once I cleared the reef, I notice the ocean floor rapidly dropping and I have never felt so unnerved in my entire life. What didn't help were the reoccurring cramps I kept getting in my left calf and hamstring. I couldn't stop my imagination from running a bit wild. I knew statistically that shark attack wasn't likely, but with the way I was cramping I couldn't stop myself from thinking I was like an endangered fish. I felt extreme sadness and regret because I knew if I died I wouldn't have left much to my son and wife.

I was about 150 yards from the shore when I saw a small boat about to pass by. I flagged them down, and they headed towards me, and helped me into the boat. The guy and his kids said they want to help me get my stuff back, so we found my boat, my cooler, and my life jacket. I lost my phone, GoPro, fishing poles, motor, and battery. I feel super shook right now. At some point I realized that I could have died and nobody would ever truly know what happened to me.",Survival

I can’t realistically carry ten days worth of water.

It will be my first time back packing, and I’m not sure which option is best. TLDR at the end.

weighing the following options: 1) boiling water each day, for daily use... 2) using a sawyer mini to filter out bacteria and UV to kill viruses.... or 3) a sawyer purifier to remove bacteria, viruses, and even chemicals pollutants.

1) Boiling water seems most foolproof, cheapest option, and effective for all pathogens. But it does nothing for non-organic contaminants like lead, etc. if oil go this route, how do I determine which water sources aren’t going to poison me with industrial runoff or some shit?

2) seems affordable, and user friendly. But doesn’t remove viruses. If I’m gathering water where other people have been ill probably guzzle noroviruses and get diarrhea in the wilderness. No thanks. But... how do I purify with UV? Just leave a clear bottle out in the sun while I hike? I mean, I can’t see UV so I can’t guess what it can penetrate- plastics, glass... what kind of bottle is conducive to UV sterilization?

3) most expensive option, but it seems almost entirely worth free. But I don’t want to spend money on a thing I can only use a couple hundred times or whatever and then have to replace.

4) I deliberately left the chemical tablets option off the list. I’m going to bring a few with me in case whatever other option I use as a first choice fails. But I hate the taste of chemically treated tap water so I don’t think I want to rely on that unless I really must.

5) I didn’t think of this until just now, but sunlight penetrates open water, if i only gather water from the top centimeter of a lake or something, would it be partially UV zapped? (I know currents constantly stir that shit up, just wondering if it makes any difference) 

6) I’ve also thought about setting up a tarp trap for rain waters and what not, to refill a jug without needing to purify. But then I’m really at the mercy of the elements and i might try that for fun, but It wouldn’t be reliable as a plan A.

Anyone ever heard a story of a survivalist finding fire by visiting the site of a lightning strike?,3,gpsrjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/gpsrjh/anyone_ever_heard_a_story_of_a_survivalist/,2,1590367101.0,"So there's this mystery:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAgMVvGB0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAgMVvGB0w)

Why do humans smell petrichor in air 200,000x better than sharks smell blood in water? Why do we smell ozone so incredibly well also? We have a lot of theories, but not much in the way of evidence.

The basic mystery is that it should take phenomenal evolutionary pressure to produce such a keen sense of smell for these scents. Humans have smaller olfactory centers in the brain and a poor sense of smell in general than most animals, yet we have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell for these petrichor and ozone. Other animals need rain too, but apparently don't have the ability to smell it nearly as well as we humans do.

There's some missing explanation. There's something that happened in human evolutionary history that made people that could smell petrichor and ozone far, FAR more likely to survive than people that couldn't. People that couldn't smell these scents tended to die and not pass on their genes. People that had a keener sense for these scents were far more likely to survive.

Whatever was happening, it must have continued to happen for evolutionary timescales. Hundreds of thousands to millions of years. For untold generations, humanity became more and more sensitive to these scents to have developed such acute senses for them.

There are a lot of theories for why this is, some say we have many desert adaptations like perspiration and a lack of body hair so we developed these senses to find water in hot arid environments. If that's the case why don't other animals have the same adaptations?

I have a different theory, I think these are adaptations our ancestors used to find fire (I'm sure I'm not the only one to come up with this). I think that the need to procure fire is the only thing that could exert that much pressure on our ancestors. Only fire could have sharpened our senses to this extent. Fire means more calories from food, food preservation, safer food, safer water and protection from the cold at night. Its also a necessary component in the production of tools from glue to needles.

I'm guessing we are very strongly adapted to sense a storm coming, so we can gather materials necessary to procure fire from nearby lightning strikes. We can smell a storm coming to give us time to get ready. We can smell ozone in the air to help us pinpoint the locations of lightning strikes quickly. Our genus has existed for millions of years on this planet, and has used fire for about that long, but I'm guessing that learning to create fire is a relatively recent invention.

The uncontacted sentinelese tribe, the one that kills anyone that sets foot on their island. They don't have the ability to create fire. They apparently have to procure it after a lightning strike.

So my question for the survival experts on this reddit is, have any of you ever heard of stories in modern times where someone procured fire from a lightning strike? Do you know of any anecdotes or tales of a person or people in a survival situation that managed to find fire in this manner?

Does this theory pass a basic plausibility test? Is finding fire in storms something that we're capable of?  


EDIT: Oh and please don't try to investigate this yourself. Lightning is dangerous and it doesn't kill a lot of people but you're way more likely to get killed if you go chasing it during a storm. ",Survival

        I also was extremely happy on a trip to Algonquin provincial Park for a 12 day canoe trip, when having cut open my hand on the gunnel of the canoe, I was happy to find several large Tegaderm in our first aid kit. As we were five days inn and it would take at least 48 hours to extricate, I was forced to attempt primary closure in the field. Utilizing both oral ethanol as well as topical, I was able to achieve both analgesia and a sterile field for closure. The applications of many overlapping Tegaderms was sufficient to create a water tight dressing that still allowed function of the hand despite frequent exposure to water. I realized that one of the most difficult issues with wound care in the wilderness is maintaining a dry dressing.

Since then I have tried to keep an ample supply of Tegaderm as well as plenty of duct tape and Sam splints when traveling in austere locations.

"What is the best handheld GPS receiver?

Preloaded maps are definitely desired, being able to upload satellite imagery and road maps is also desired, along with navigation capability.  The higher resolution and more data I can store the better.  

The 1 requirement that is a 100% must is it must be a receiver ONLY.

Total pack weight inclusive of water and all food \~40-50 pounds. Haven't actually weighed it. Feels like a bag of feed when I pick it up. LOL.

The plan is to backpack in about three miles up a creek in Arizona's Rim country, set up base camp for 2-3 days and hike and explore the area. Then I'll move a mile or two up the creek, and rinse, lather, repeat, until I'm either tired of sleeping on the ground and scratching mosquito bites, or I have to go back to work. I expect I'll be out there something between seven and nine days. I will be surprised if I see anyone else; I'm going to be way off the beaten track.

I just wore a small hole in them finally, which is enough to let water in once you stand in a quarter inch of water or so. Soooo... not good.

My problem is that this is the first decent pair of boots I ever had. And I don't really know what is on the market that I should take a close look at, and what I should steer clear of. So, I thought I'd ask the Survival sub, since most of you are about getting the most out of any piece of gear you decide to use.

I am specifically looking for **hiking** boots, but they will be all purpose. I use them any time I think I might be stepping anywhere dirty, when I might be doing outdoor work, and so on. Also, of course, any time I go hiking, camping, or if any shtf scenario occurred. And when it is raining. Waterproof is absolutely necessary and non-negotiable. (And I don't really know about a steel toe, but my first impression is that I would prefer not to have one) All I'm really familiar with is Hi-Tec, which is what I am replacing. They were pretty good, though, I feel like they might have been a been bulky/heavy. And I can't help but wonder if boots can last a bit longer. Then, I am familiar with Columbia and Timberland... and North Face. Though, I have not had any products from any of them. I know Columbia jackets get high praise, but I don't know anything about the foot wear. 

I was just looking at a company called Danner, and another called Keen. But I don't really know anything about them.

I'm hoping you guys can offer me a push in the right direction on where to look? I am really not joking when I say I consider this to be my most important piece of survival equipment. Lt. Dan would agree. WWI showcased the importance of keeping your feet dry. And not to mention I grew up a westerner, where we wear shoes, so my feet are not at all adapted in any way where I could even think about trying to go barefoot outdoors on anything but soft grass. If I'm struggling to even walk, then getting shelter and water suddenly becomes a much harder task.

I really appreciate any and all input you guys have. This is a purchase that I will do quite a bit of research on before pulling the trigger on buying. I need to be sure I'm getting good quality. This last pair of boots I had cost me 60, I think my limit is 100, hard limit 120.",Survival
